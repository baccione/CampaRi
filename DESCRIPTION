Description: Analysis algorithms extracted from the original 'campari' software package.
  They consists in a kinetic annotation of the trajectory based on the minimum spanning tree
  constructed on the distances between snapshots. The fast algorithm is implemented on
  the basis of a modified version of the birch algorithm, while the slow one is based on a
  simple leader clustering. For more information please visit the original documentation
