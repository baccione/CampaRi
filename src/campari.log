 Multiple distance functions selected. They will be  balanced using clustering valuse, then summed toghether in a old fashion way.\nRemember that the leader clustering algorithm will consider only the first value of the distances

 Selected distances:            5          11
 Distance weights:   0.00000000       0.00000000    

 Input dimensions:        1000  row and           42  col




 Now using truncated leader algorithm for pre-clusteringin neighbor list generation ...
 ... done with initial cluster generation for distances list with a total number of            1  clusters

 Now computing cutoff-assisted neighbor list...


 Distance method:            5

 Normalization mode active. Max value:  0.971426666    


 Distance method:           11

 Normalization mode active. Max value:   1.04453480    

 ... done after computing    100.000000     % of possible terms with    100.000000     % successful.

 Neighbor list generated.



 Now creating global sorted list of neighbor pairs ...
 ... done.

 Now generating MST by considering shortest remaining link and merging ...
 ... done.
