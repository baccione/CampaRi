<h2>Tutorial 4: Testing Move Sets - How to Establish Global Balance in a
Monte Carlo Move Set</h2>
<h3>Preface:</h3>
In conformational space sampling whether it be using Monte Carlo
Sampling or
Dynamics, one can define a "degree of freedom" as any system descriptor
that changes during the sampling process. In Cartesian sampling
the degrees
of freedom are the X, Y, and Z positions of all atoms. In a sufficient space
of internal coordinates (Z-matrix), the degrees for freedom for molecular systems
can correspond to the bond lengths, bond angles and torsional angles
of the structure. The transformation operation to convert between the
two coordinate frames has to be well-defined (unique, reversible mapping).
In multimolecular systems, intermolecular degrees of freedom could be 
expressed by pseudo-internal coordinates that, however, do not carry
intuitive meaning. Therefore, it is just as well possible to define
the reference frame for each molecule by using that molecule's first three
atoms' coordinates. This implies six degrees of freedom (nine total minus
one implied bond angle minus two implied bond lengths).<br/><br/>
Monte Carlo sampling in CAMPARI happens explicitly in a rigid-body /
torsional coordinate frame, <i>i.e.</i>, an internal coordinate reference frame
that used explicit constraints on bond lengths and bond angles.
There are exceptions to the imposition of constraints, for example
when using the simplified concerted approach of <a href="references.html#ref14_3">Ulmschneider and Jorgensen</a> (see <a
 href="keywords.html#ANGCRFREQ">FMCSC_ANGCRFREQ</a>), when
sampling the puckering of 5-membered rings (see <a
 href="keywords.html#PKRFREQ">FMCSC_PKRFREQ</a> and <a
 href="keywords.html#SUGARFREQ">FMCSC_SUGARFREQ</a>), and when using
inexact chemical crosslinks (see <a
 href="keywords.html#CRLK_MODE">FMCSC_CRLK_MODE</a>). In general, however, the 
Monte Carlo degrees of freedom sampled in CAMPARI are the
torsional angles of the backbone, the torsional angles of sidechains,
and the rigid-body coordinates of all molecules (rotation and translation).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The simplest type of sampling move changes the value of only one degree of freedom
in completely random (unbiased) fashion as an elementary step. CAMPARI also implements several
advanced sampling techniques, such as concerted rotations, <i>i.e.</i>
concerted (coupled) changes to several degrees of freedom at once in order
to satisfy some external constraint. These complex moves
usually serve to increase the efficiency of sampling certain regions of
conformational space that are easily only accessible through correlated
changes in several degrees of freedom at once (and not via multiple,
independent perturbations of individual degrees of freedom). The domain of a
single degree of freedom is the range of all possible values it can
assume.<br/><br/>
We can therefore define "ergodicity" for the move set as the requirement
to - at least theoretically - be able to construct a chain of Monte Carlo moves, which
allow the system to visit any point in phase space given the coordinate frame phase space
is defined in. We can also define that "global balance" holds
if each point in phase space is visited with equal likelihood in the absence of
an energetic bias (Boltzmann weights are all equal).<br/>
In reality, ergodicity is usually easier to understand conceptually given a move set.
Numerically, establishing ergodicity and global balance require the
same basic methodology. Note that a move set consists of different move types,
and that it is quite possible for individual move types to fail the "ergodicity"
requirement if considered by themselves. Such a case exists for instance with exact concerted
rotation moves for which the ends of the chain are strictly unable to move relative to one
another (and which therefore have to combined with other move types to yield
an ergodic move set).<br/>
Global balance is much trickier to assert conceptually, and often entails the use of
elaborate corrections in the MC acceptance step. To circumvent having to perform
any numerical tests of ergodicity and global balance, 
it is often formally proven that the move set obeys detailed balance, 
a sufficient but not necessary condition ensuring global balance. For this
reason and the reason that such a formal proof does not constitute a test
of an actual implementation, one can and should perform basic numerical
tests as is done in this tutorial.<br/><br/>
Most often it will only be possible to collect 1D-histograms for most of the degrees
of freedom in the infinite temperature (maximum entropy) limit, <i>i.e.</i>
in the absence of a Hamiltonian. When plotting those histograms, we 
expect them to be flat within some level of noise stemming from the
finite length of the simulation. This does not address other parts of global balance
such as the statistical independence of conceptually independent degrees
of freedom. For example, a move set that randomly sets the &phi;/&psi;-angles in 
a polypeptide to the <i>same</i> random value would appear balanced when analyzing
1D-histograms only. If we, however, create a 2D-histogram of &phi;/&psi;-values
it would become immediately clear that such a move is not ergodic, and will not
- even when mixed with other moves - produce a globally balanced distribution.
This example shows that ultimately it is the N<sub>f</sub>-dimensional 
distribution function that is of interest to us (N<sub>f</sub> being
the number of degrees of freedom) that is of course impossible to
analyze directly for any system of appreciable size.<br/><br/>
In the following, we will guide you through the process of testing
whether a given CAMPARI move set appears unbiased when considering 
low-dimensional projections. With explicit knowledge of the level of coupling
introduced by the move set, this can often be enough to safely conclude
that it is in fact globally balanced.<br/>
<h3>Step-by-Step:</h3>
<h5>Step 1 -
Study and understand the components of the move set</h5>
Inspect the section titled "# Monte Carlo Sampler" in the 
<a href="../examples/tutorial4/MOVESETS.key">key-file for this tutorial</a>
found in the corresponding subdirectory (example/tutorial4/). The move set
in CAMPARI is a binary decision tree with the parameters for each binary
decision being controllable through a single "frequency" keyword. Binary 
decisions toward the root of the tree will naturally effect the <i>overall</i>
frequency of moves accessible in all downstream branches.<br/>
<br/>
The primary classes of moves are controlled by the following keywords (ordered hierarchically
starting at the root):<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PARTICLEFLUCFREQ">FMCSC_PARTICLEFLUCFREQ</a> - Moves for the grand-canonical
ensemble (sampling particle number as degree of freedom)<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#RIGIDFREQ">FMCSC_RIGIDFREQ</a> - Moves for rigid-body coordinates of molecules<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CHIFREQ">FMCSC_CHIFREQ</a> - Moves for dihedral angles in branches (sidechains) of polymers<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CRFREQ">FMCSC_CRFREQ</a> - Concerted rotation moves for polypeptides<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#OMEGAFREQ">FMCSC_OMEGAFREQ</a> - &omega;-angle sampling for polypeptides<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NUCFREQ">FMCSC_NUCFREQ</a> - Sampling moves for nucleic acids<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PKRFREQ">FMCSC_PKRFREQ</a> - Sampling moves for pucker angles in polypeptides<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#OTHERFREQ">FMCSC_OTHERFREQ</a> - Sampling moves for single dihedral angles<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PIVOTMODE">&phi;/&psi;-moves</a> - The "drop-through" moves are polypeptide &phi;/&psi;-moves<br/>
<br/>
It is important to realize that some of these moves contain much more complex subbranches than
others. For instance, &omega;-moves for polypeptides are only split into two variants - 
stepwise vs. fully randomizing (&rarr; <a href="keywords.html#OMEGARDFREQ">FMCSC_OMEGARDFREQ</a>).
Conversely, the nucleic acid branch contains several different moves
(&rarr; <a href="keywords.html#NUCCRFREQ">FMCSC_NUCCRFREQ</a> or <a href="keywords.html#SUGARFREQ">FMCSC_SUGARFREQ</a>).
This tutorial tests elements in all of the above branches with the exception of the branch
pertaining to particle number fluctuations.
If you inspect the <a href="../examples/tutorial4/MOVESETS.key">key-file</a>
further, you may also note that:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Alternative implementations of &phi;/&psi;-moves for polypeptides are not tested (&rarr;
<a href="keywords.html#COUPLE">FMCSC_COUPLE</a> or <a href="keywords.html#PIVOTMODE">FMCSC_PIVOTMODE</a>).</li>
<li>Concerted rotation for polypeptides with bond angle variations is disabled (&rarr; <a
 href="keywords.html#ANGCRFREQ">FMCSC_ANGCRFREQ</a>).</li>
<li>No exclusive rotations (without translation) of rigid-bodies are attempted (&rarr;
<a href="keywords.html#ROTFREQ">FMCSC_ROTFREQ</a>).</li>
<li>Moves operating on unsupported residues in CAMPARI (compare <a href="tutorial12.html">Tutorial 12</a>) are
excluded (&rarr; <a href="keywords.html#OTHERUNKFREQ">FMCSC_OTHERUNKFREQ</a>).</li>
<li>Titration pseudo-moves are omitted (&rarr;
<a href="keywords.html#PHFREQ">FMCSC_PHFREQ</a>).</li>
<li>Only a single setting for each dependent control keyword will be explored (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href="keywords.html#NRCHI">FMCSC_NRCHI</a>).</li>
</ol>
Some features are skipped because they do not qualify as proper MC moves, because
usage is discouraged (quasi-obsolete features), or because they are incompatible
with other more important features. Take the time to read up on the move types
that are going to be in use as a conceptual understanding of the
moves is indispensable in order to interpret the results. You should be
familiar with all of the dependent keywords. If you plan to test
a specific move set meant to be used in actual simulations, simply replace the appropriate
settings.<br/>
<br/>
If you inspect the section titled "# Hamiltonian" in the <a href="../examples/tutorial4/MOVESETS.key">key-file</a>,
you will note that two energy terms are in fact enabled. These are bonded
potentials. Bond length energies should remain rigorously constant throughout
the simulation (this can be used as a test to the rigorous enforcement of
the implied constraints). Bond angle terms are needed for two algorithms
dedicated to the sampling of ring pucker states (&rarr; <a href="keywords.html#PKRFREQ">FMCSC_PKRFREQ</a>
and <a href="keywords.html#SUGARFREQ">FMCSC_SUGARFREQ</a>) that fail numerically
if extreme values for bond angles were allowed. Given an implicit set of constraints
(here, constant bond lengths all around), it is not at all easy to define a meaningful
expectation for the infinite temperature ensemble either. We will therefore sample
ring pucker states given a (strictly local) Hamiltonian. The property
of bonded potentials to only affect those degrees of freedom they act on
directly is very important since it allows the remainder of the results
to stay meaningful.<br/>
<h5>Step 2 -
Run the simulation to obtain distribution (histogram) data on degrees of freedom</h5>
Copy all the files from the examples/tutorial4/ subdirectory into a writable
working directory. Adjust any file paths as needed. Note that the
<a href="../examples/tutorial4/tutorial4.seq">sequence file in use</a>
corresponds to an arbitrary system meant to allow for testing most of the
possible move types in a single simulation.<br/>
<br/>
The actual calculation is run by:<br/>
<br/><tt>
campari -k MOVESETS.key &gt;&amp; movesets.log<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Even though only extremely limited energy evaluations are needed, the calculation
will need some time to complete due to the computational cost of exact concerted
rotation moves (&rarr; <a href="keywords.html#TORCRFREQ">FMCSC_TORCRFREQ</a> and
<a href="keywords.html#NUCCRFREQ">FMCSC_NUCCRFREQ</a>) and, to a lesser extent,
the cost of data collection routines. That said,
the run should not take more than a few hours at the specified length. While it is certainly possible
to shorten runtime by reducing <a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">NRSTEPS</a>, a proper
result in statistical terms does in fact require a fairly lengthy simulation.<br/>
<h5>Step 3 -
Analyze distribution data</h5>
Once the simulation is finished, we can use the simulation output to collect evidence 
that the move set works properly. It is important to note that from the construction
of the move set we know that certain degrees of freedom will always be sampled independent
of one another. Therefore, we can also analyze them independently:<br/>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Rigid-body coordinates:<br/>
It is rather inconvenient to obtain the spatial distribution function with
respect to the laboratory frame, so we will instead analyze the relative
distribution functions by means of pair correlation functions g(r) obtained
between the centers of mass of the individual molecules. For this, simply plot
all columns in output file <a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">RBC_PC.dat</a>
from the third one up against the intermolecular distance in the first column.
Apart from noise, they should all be flat and equal to unity everywhere.
We do not test rigid-body rotation here (see below).</li>
  <li>Sidechain dihedral (&chi;-)angles:<br/>
Freely rotatable &chi;-angles are sampled by at most two types of moves, <i>viz.</i>, 
<a href="keywords.html#CHIFREQ">dedicated sidechain moves</a> and 
<a href="keywords.html#OTHERNATFREQ">single torsion pivot moves on native CAMPARI degrees of freedom</a>.
This implies that only very basic moves are applied to these dihedral angles.
The first thing you can do is to open output file
<a href="outputfiles.html#INTERNAL_COORDS.idx">INTERNAL_COORDS.idx</a>,
and to search manually for the correct entries in the dihedrals section.
Then, plot the appropriate columns in the final containing torsional
histograms, <i>viz.</i>, <a href="outputfiles.html#INTHISTS_DI.dat">INTHISTS_DI.dat</a>.
All the corresponding histograms should be flat. To test for independence between
concurrently sampled &chi;-angles, open output file <a href="outputfiles.html#FYC.dat">FYC.dat</a>,
and identify two or more columns giving the values for &chi;-angles on
the <i>same</i> residue. Given the chosen <a href="keywords.html#TOROUT">output mode</a> for this file,
you may require a <a href="outputfiles.html#basename_START.int">Z-matrix file</a> for 
reference. Construct 2D or higher histograms and visualize them; they
again should be flat.</li>
  <li>Pucker states:<br/>
Variables characterizing saliently the pucker state of each flexible ring in the
system (including bond angles) would be reported in output file <a href="outputfiles.html#FYC.dat">FYC.dat</a>
for the other <a href="keywords.html#TOROUT">output mode</a>. In our case, only dihedral angles
will be listed.
Therefore, for bond angles, plot the data in <a href="outputfiles.html#INTHISTS_BA.dat">INTHISTS_BA.dat</a> to
look at the 1D histograms directly. Use <a href="outputfiles.html#INTERNAL_COORDS.idx">INTERNAL_COORDS.idx</a> to identify
the correct columns.
Plot the implied probability densities along
with the correct weights expected for an isolated (<i>i.e.</i>, not coupled to other degrees of freedom
by a set of constraints) bond angle of each type.
These can be constructed as p(&alpha;)=exp[-U(&alpha;)/k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>sim</sub>]/(Q&#183;&delta;<sub>bin</sub>). Here,
k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>sim</sub> is the thermal energy, U(&alpha;) is the bonded
potential in use for a particular angle, Q is the appropriate normalization constant
(partition function), and &delta;<sub>bin</sub> is the bin size used to 
construct the simulation histogram. By having specified <a href="keywords.html#BONDREPORT">FMCSC_BONDREPORT</a>
to be true, the log file will contain a section listing explicitly which
bond angle potential acts on which combination of atoms. With this number, consult
the parameter file in use (<a href="keywords.html#abs32_charmm_prm">abs3.2_charmm.prm</a> here)
and the <a href="parameters.html#S6_Bond_angle_potential_types">proper documentation</a>
to find parameters and functional form that will allow you to compute U(&alpha;) explicitly.
This is only an approximate test meant to identify major flaws (quantitative
matches cannot be expected). It should not be used for cases where the set of coupled bond
angle parameters produces stress in conjunction with the fixed bond lengths (can be diagnosed
by isolating the residue in question and evaluating the total bond angle energy in <a href="outputfiles.html#ENERGY.dat">ENERGY.dat</a>
of a new simulation). For the particular case here, the analysis for proline is probably more meaningful than
that for nucleotides.
Note that potentials acting on dependent angle terms involving atoms bound covalently
to ring atoms also influence the distributions.
All the pucker degrees of freedom are coupled, and probing their independence
is meaningless (although visualizing their level of coupling may be instructive).
As one additional test, you can compare the dihedral angle statistics for two
proline residues with opposite chirality and make sure they are mirror images
of one another (for example for the C<sub>i-1</sub>-N-C<sub>&alpha;</sub>-C<sub>&beta;</sub> torsion).</li>
  <li>Polypeptide &phi;/&psi;-angles:<br/>
Visualize the 2D-histogram corresponding to the &phi;/&psi;-distribution for
the lysine residue in the second molecule in the <a href="../examples/tutorial4/tutorial4.seq">sequence file</a>.
This residue is only sampled by regular pivot &phi;/&psi;-moves. The 
<a href="outputfiles.html#RESRAMA_xxxxx.dat">output file</a> should be called
"RESRAMA_00013.dat". Next, do the same for the two residues for which
we also requested residue-specific &phi;/&psi;-maps (via keyword
<a href="keywords.html#RAMARES">FMCSC_RAMARES</a>). These are both
part of a longer polypeptide and are therefore sampled by all types
of polypeptide backbone moves that we enabled. All of the histograms
should appear flat. Lastly, find entries corresponding to &phi;/&psi;-angles
by either of the two methods used above and (construct and) visualize 
the corresponding 1D histograms. Inspect those histograms corresponding
to the first polypeptide with particular care as the biased move types applied to it are much more likely to introduce minor errors.
Feel free to attempt constructing higher-dimensional distribution functions
(the theoretical level of coupling for concerted rotation moves is too high, though)
from the data in <a href="outputfiles.html#FYC.dat">FYC.dat</a>.</li>
 <li>Nucleic acid backbone dihedral angles:<br/>
Proceed exactly as for &phi;/&psi;-angles. The only exceptions are that 
you need to create all 2D (or higher) histograms yourself, and that the
reference system using only pivot-type nucleic acid backbone moves is 
the free deoxycytidine monophosphate (CMP). The pivot moves come from two different classe,
<i>viz.</i>, <a href="keywords.html#OTHERNATFREQ">single torsion pivot moves on native CAMPARI degrees of freedom</a>
and <a href="keywords.html#NUCFREQ">dedicated nucleic acid pivot moves</a>.</li>
  <li>Other dihedral angles:<br/>
Freely rotatable dihedral angles not covered thus far are sample by exactly one move type, <i>i.e.</i>
<a href="keywords.html#OTHERFREQ">single torsion pivot moves</a>.
These moves are very simple, and biases are highly unlikely. Nevertheless,
proceed as before using the output in <a href="outputfiles.html#FYC.dat">FYC.dat</a>
and <a href="outputfiles.html#INTHISTS_DI.dat">INTHISTS_DI.dat</a> to produce or 
inspect the relevant histograms. Use a <a href="outputfiles.html#basename_START.int">Z-matrix file</a> 
to identify the indices associated with these degrees of freedom. Since these degrees of freedom
are accessed individually and not on a per-residue basis (as for most other moves), there
is no theoretical foundation to assume correlations to appear.</li>
</ol>
If desired, the simulation can of course be modified to offer much more output that can be used
to assess the sanity of move sets through alternative routes. Keep in mind, however,
that more complex and indirect functions of degrees of freedom may help with analyses
of coupling, but may also mask errors otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
The following aspects are not at all tested when following the instructions above:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Rigid-body rotation: Testing this is not trivial, but is crudely
done by taking a molecule with non-spherical symmetry and applying only
rotation moves to it. The resultant gyration tensor with respect to the static
laboratory frame should then be isotropic.</li>
  <li>Absolute spatial sampling with respect to the laboratory frame. This can be 
analyzed by performing <a href="keywords.html#EMCALC">spatial density analysis</a> 
and subsequent visualization. Note that this tutorial uses <a href="keywords.html#BOUNDARY">3D periodic boundary conditions</a>.
In restraining boundary conditions, there is an additional complication related to 
<a href="keywords.html#RIGIDRDFREQ">randomizing rigid-body moves</a> (see also discussion
on keyword <a href="keywords.html#RIGIDRDBUF">FMCSC_RIGIDRDBUF</a>).</li>
  <li>Modified move sets that are conceptually identical but use (drastically) different
choices for dependent parameters.</li>
  <li>Additional move set options as mentioned previously.</li>
