<h2>Tutorial 12: Simulations of Systems Containing Entities Not Supported Natively by CAMPARI</h2>
<h3>Preface:</h3>
<a href="tutorial10.html">Tutorial 10</a> has already illustrated a variety of concepts useful in dealing
with entities (residues) that are not supported natively by CAMPARI. While it is going to be tedious simulating
completely new polymer types or complex assemblies such as lipid bilayers using the ideas presented
here, simulations of proteins containing nonstandard amino acids or nucleotides and exotic small molecules
are extremely common and can be accomplished without much difficulty. As with any simulation of 
nonstandard systems in any software package, parameterization is a concern. Therefore, the first step should
be to figure out what parameters are going to be needed and how to obtain them. The latter is not part
of this tutorial as it is a task that is largely independent. We will merely demonstrate how to incorporate 
parameters into a CAMPARI simulation using the extensive patch facility. Before going into the details of the
system, you should remind yourself that some parameters are or can be guessed by CAMPARI. Specifically, these are
bonded parameters (angles and bond lengths) that
can be set with flat force constants based on the initial geometry (see <a href="keywords.html#GUESS_BONDED">FMCSC_GUESS_BONDED</a>)
and automatic guesses for the Lennard-Jones atom type (based on matching valency, symbol, <i>etc</i>).<br/>
It is also crucial to know whether simulations are meant to happen in <a href="keywords.html#CARTINT">internal coordinate space and/or Cartesian space</a>.
Both are fraught with different types of difficulties. In Cartesian space, all atoms are theoretically mobile 
requiring extensive incorporation of bonded parameters (via <a href="keywords.html#BPATCHFILE">FMCSC_BPATCHFILE</a>)
and/or the setting up of <a href="keywords.html#SHAKESET">custom constraint sets</a>. Since this work flow is
typical for the majority of simulation software packages, it may be worthwhile to think about creating a script
to translate parameters generated by or assigned within a different package. In addition to all other parameters,
additional difficulties can be associated with <a href="keywords.html#FUDGE_ST_14">14-fudge factors</a> and similar
exceptions meant to correct errors with nonbonded interactions applied to atoms that are topologically close. In general,
the standard models for <a href="keywords.html#INTERMODEL">the general interaction model</a> and 
<a href="keywords.html#ELECMODEL">short-range electrostatic interactions</a> will behave most straightforwardly.
The other treatments need to know specifics of the system, <i>e.g.</i>, regarding local rigidity of ring systems.
CAMPARI tries to infer as many of these properties as possible. The goal is to pass a stringent test, <i>i.e.</i>, that results
for a run starting from a <a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">pdb input file</a> containing supported residues are not
altered upon renaming residues such that CAMPARI treats them as unsupported ones. Ideally, this should hold for a wide range of simulation settings.
In reality, it cannot be expected to work perfectly under all instances. Consider for example the unique
<a href="keywords.html#INTERMODEL">GROMOS exclusion rules</a> for nucleotide bases. There is basically no way
to transfer the underlying "concept" automatically to analogous systems, since these adjustments are more or less <i>adhoc</i>.<br/>
A treatment in rigid-body / torsional space may obviate the need for a number of bonded parameters (for rigid ring systems).
Here, the main additional complication is that one has to rely on a correct (or meaningful)
identification of the degrees of freedom. Because the Z-matrix is inferred from the input <a href="keywords.html#PDB_TEMPLATE">structure</a>,
reordering atoms in the template may sometimes be the only way to achieve the desired result. The situation
is worse if the desired degrees of freedom are not generally suitable for simple sampling algorithms in 
torsional space, <i>i.e.</i>, if there are flexible rings. This, however, is not a problem specific to the scope
of this tutorial (<i>e.g.</i>, proline and ribose rings are currently frozen during internal coordinate space
dynamics runs). By fiddling with atom names in the <a href="keywords.html#PDB_TEMPLATE">template file</a>, it is possible to direct
CAMPARI to assign appropriate atom types, but in general it will be safer to set these explicitly with
an <a href="keywords.html#LJPATCHFILE">atom type patch</a> or a <a href="keywords.html#BIOTYPEPATCHFILE">biotype patch</a>.<br/>
The tutorial will proceed through a series of steps that would be typical for setting up a simulation with unsupported residues.
First, we relax the input geometry, which requires appropriate bonded parameters. Next, we test whether the system can
be sampled successfully with CAMPARI's Monte Carlo engine. With this in place, we implement a crude parameterization for simulations
with a physically realistic model (<a href="keywords.html#SC_IMPSOLV">ABSINTH implicit solvation model</a>). Finally,
we perform a short production simulation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Step-by-Step:</h3>
<h5>Step 1 - Basic settings and geometry relaxation</h5>
The specific system we wish to simulate is defined in <a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.pdb">tutorial12.pdb</a>.
It consists of a small molecule not natively supported by CAMPARI (2-hydroxyethyl ammonium ion), a short peptide with a single
residue of unsupported type (<i>(5S)</i>-5-hydroxylysine), and ADP represented as AMP (RPA) with an unsupported 5' phosphate cap.
This parsing into residues is one possible choice, and it would also have been possible to define ADP as a single
residue. If there are components of the system natively supported by CAMPARI, however, there usually is little advantage
in masking this. The <a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.in">sequence file</a> naturally needs to
reflect the choice we made. Note that the small molecule (EAM) requires explicit termini settings (unlike
the built-in small molecules, <i>i.e.</i>, it must read "EAM_N_C").
If you visualize <a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.pdb">tutorial12.pdb</a>, it
is possible to see that the geometry is not very accurate in parts. Note that this is not necessarily a safe
starting point, <i>i.e.</i>, if the system is meant to contain rings or is in a conformation creating
relatively short nonbonded distances, then the topology may be inferred incorrectly. This is why it is
always recommended to check the <a href="outputfiles.html#basename_START.int">Z-matrix file generated initially</a>.<br/>
Our first objective is to perform a short relaxation run (minimization) in Cartesian space. For this, we
do not want to use any constraints, so correct bonded potentials are required for all system components. Given
a suitable <a href="keywords.html#PARAMETERS">parameter file</a>, the supported residues are covered, but the unsupported
entities including their potential linkages to supported entities are not.
While possible, the manual patching of bonded parameters with the help of the corresponding
<a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_BPATCHFILE">patch file</a> 
becomes tedious even for systems as tiny as this one. Unless scripts are in place to handle this semiautomatically,
it is usually easier to take advantage of the fact that the
parameter file itself may already provide bonded parameters for various types of chemical linkages. If so,
then a <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_BTPATCHFILE">biotype patch</a> will be much more efficient. Biotype
patches are the highest-level patches CAMPARI offers, and change all atomic parameters assigned via the 
parameter file (atom type for Lennard-Jones interactions, partial charge, bonded interactions, mass, <i>etc</i>).<br/>
To provide a more thorough overview of various keywords involved, we write the key-file from scratch. Here,
we take advantage of many default settings, so if you are missing something you think should have been specified, 
have a look at the summary portions of the simulation outputs and/or consult the documentation of the keyword in question.<br/>
As usual, create an empty directory and copy the files in the example directory for Tutorial 12 over. In addition, 
make a copy of parameter file <a href="keywords.html#abs32_charmm_prm">abs3.2_charmm.prm</a> in the local directory
(it is going to be modified &rarr; <a href="../params/abs3.2_charmm.prm">link to the actual file</a>).
We then start as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a> abs3.2_charmm.prm<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_IPP">FMCSC_SC_IPP</a> 0.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SIZE">FMCSC_SIZE</a> 40. 40. 40.<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ORIGIN">FMCSC_ORIGIN</a> 0. 0. 0.<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_BONDED_B">FMCSC_SC_BONDED_B</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_BONDED_A">FMCSC_SC_BONDED_A</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_BONDED_I">FMCSC_SC_BONDED_I</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_BONDED_T">FMCSC_SC_BONDED_T</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">FMCSC_PDBFILE</a> tutorial12.pdb<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SEQFILE">FMCSC_SEQFILE</a> tutorial12.in<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CARTINT">FMCSC_CARTINT</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#DYNAMICS">FMCSC_DYNAMICS</a> 6<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_GRMS">FMCSC_MINI_GRMS</a> 0.0001<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_MODE">FMCSC_MINI_MODE</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> 10000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#EQUIL">FMCSC_EQUIL</a> 10000000<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This defines our system to simulate, selects an appropriate box size, and creates a Hamiltonian encompassing only bonded terms.
It asks for a short minimization run in Cartesian space (it is not possible to relax or sample
covalent geometries using Monte Carlo). You should feel free to read up on the minimization options in case
they are not clear.
If we tried to run this simulation, it would most likely run through. However, the presence of bonded interactions (inferred from 
initial topology) in conjunction with the absence of any potentials citing on them would lead to the unsupported atoms drifting away,
which is obviously not what was meant by "relax the geometry." The continuous evaluation of these terms may also lead
to numerical instabilities (bond angles near 180&deg;). Warnings would be printed to log output indicating the missing support for the atoms in unsupported residues
and/or valence errors (the latter can always be skipped by using <a href="keywords.html#UNSAFE">FMCSC_UNSAFE</a>).
This is because, by default, CAMPARI will create a new biotype for every unique atom type occurring in unsupported residues.
These types only have the most basic support, <i>i.e.</i>, one of the existing <a href="parameters.html#S2_LJ-types">atom (Lennard Jones) types</a>
in the parameter file has been assigned to every unsupported atom by CAMPARI. Since our system does not contain chemical
moieties or linkages that are fundamentally different from what is found in supported residues, we will go the route
of reassigning biotypes to fix the majority of these issues.<br/>
Inspect the corresponding <a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.btpi">patch file</a>. It contains
a simple list of assignment operations. Since the order of biotypes is the same for all CAMPARI parameter files,
these types of patches are also more portable (some dummy atom types in CHARMM-based parameter files appended at the
end may require a constant shift when switching between CHARMM-based or other parameter sets).
From the file you can see, for example, that the majority of biotype
assignments for the modified lysine residue correspond to the standard lysine biotypes, which is obviously the best
starting point. The three largest biotype values in the file should not be supported by the parameter file (but it may
already have been modified &rarr; adjustments needed). You should append the parameter file directly with:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
biotype   1098    CD      "Hydroxylysine"             2    0   15<br/>
biotype   1099    OE2     "Hydroxylysine"             6    0   45<br/>
biotype   1100    HE2     "Hydroxylysine"             4    0    1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Index numbers may have to be adjusted. 
Note that we are only setting <a href="parameters.html#S2_LJ-types">LJ atom types</a> and <a href="parameters.html#S9_Bonded_types">bonded
types</a>. It would also be possible to repurpose existing biotypes for this task, but new biotypes are the cleaner solution.
Next, append the key-file with:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#BIOTYPEPATCHFILE">FMCSC_BIOTYPEPATCHFILE</a> tutorial12.btpi<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Now try running the simulation:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial12.key &gt; try.log<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The minimization appears to finish normally, but inspection of "try.log" reveals some warnings about missing
bond angle terms. The relevant terms are listed in detail. In this case, they all come from the presence of the tertiary carbon
atom at the alcohol site (C<sub>&delta;</sub>). Ignoring them may lead to an unacceptable geometry that is
also conceptually unusable as input for future runs. 
We have two options of dealing with this problem. First, we can explicitly patch the missing terms 
(via <a href="keywords.html#BPATCHFILE">FMCSC_BPATCHFILE</a>). Second, we can instruct CAMPARI to derive
default terms from the input geometry (via <a href="keywords.html#GUESS_BONDED">FMCSC_GUESS_BONDED</a>).
The latter is rarely a useful option, because input geometries read from pdb are inaccurate to begin 
with (lacking precision). Here, we decide to patch 3/4 terms with the supplied
 <a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.bpi">patch file</a>. These are the ones for which the parent
force field (CHARMM) does not appear to make distinctions between CH, CH<sub>2</sub>, or CH<sub>3</sub> moieties. 
Fur the purpose of this tutorial, the last term will be inferred from the input geometry.
Append the key-file with:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#BPATCHFILE">FMCSC_BPATCHFILE</a> tutorial12.bpi<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#GUESS_BONDED">FMCSC_GUESS_BONDED</a> 1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Now try running the simulation:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial12.key &gt;&amp;minim.log<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This should finish in less than a second. Store the final structure for use in subsequent steps:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
mv yourcalc_END.pdb tutorial12_minimized.pdb<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
You should visually compare the two structures.  Note that molecular visualization software may have problems
inferring the correct bonds in the 5'-phosphate due to the unusual residue name (the "CONECT" records are
not maintained in the CAMPARI-generated pdb-files).
As a note of caution, it should be pointed out that the parameter file contains only stiff bonded terms. Even so, however, it is possible that
these parameter were in reality coparameterized with other (bonded or nonbonded) terms and/or that
they represent a frustrated landscape, <i>i.e.</i>, not all minimum positions of the harmonic terms
are attainable at the same time. Both issues can in theory lead to undesired results for a protocol
as used here. Lastly, the question as to what could have gone wrong at this stage is of relevance.
The most likely scenario involves erroneous ring closures in the inferred Z-matrix. These will result
from steric clashes, <i>i.e.</i>, distances between two nonbonded atoms that are too short. The
consequences of assuming rings where there are none can be dramatic. Specifically, the setup of nonbonded
interactions can be compromised (leading to nonsensical energies reported), the identification of 
affected dihedral angle degrees of freedom will fail, and the ability to use appropriate bonded
potentials will be limited. Users are advised to check the input geometry before suspecting a different
type of error. Fortunately, most visualization software packages include structure editing/manipulation tools by now, 
which are capable of making the required adjustments to an input structure.<br/>
<h5>Step 2 - Setting up the system for Monte Carlo sampling</h5>
The degrees of freedom of the system in unsupported residues (in terms of dihedral angles) are determined automatically from
the input structure (&rarr; <a href="keywords.html#PDB_TEMPLATE">details</a>). We will first enable
only two types of moves for sampling this system: <a href="keywords.html#RIGIDFREQ">rigid-body moves</a> and
<a href="keywords.html#OTHERFREQ">single dihedral angle pivot moves</a>. Append the key-file
as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#RIGIDFREQ">FMCSC_RIGIDFREQ</a> 0.2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NUCFREQ">FMCSC_NUCFREQ</a> 0.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CHIFREQ">FMCSC_CHIFREQ</a> 0.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#OMEGAFREQ">FMCSC_OMEGAFREQ</a> 0.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#OTHERFREQ">FMCSC_OTHERFREQ</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#OTHERUNKFREQ">FMCSC_OTHERUNKFREQ</a> 0.5<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#OTHERNATFREQ">FMCSC_OTHERNATFREQ</a> 0.8<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This turns on the two move types mentioned with remaining parameters left at default values. Of course,
we also need to make modifications to existing keywords:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_IPP">FMCSC_SC_IPP</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CARTINT">FMCSC_CARTINT</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#DYNAMICS">FMCSC_DYNAMICS</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> 100000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#EQUIL">FMCSC_EQUIL</a> 10000<br/>
## <a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">FMCSC_PDBFILE</a> tutorial12.pdb<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This disables the original read-in from tutorial12.pdb, changes the sampler to MC in internal coordinate space,
extends the run length, and enables excluded volume interactions and on-the-fly analyses.
Of course, we still need to supply CAMPARI with the topology information about the 
unsupported residues. However, we want to use the minimized structure for this purpose, and we want
the initial structure to be randomized:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#RANDOMIZE">FMCSC_RANDOMIZE</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_TEMPLATE">FMCSC_PDB_TEMPLATE</a> tutorial12_minimized.pdb<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Here, we instruct CAMPARI to just extract a functional Z-matrix for all unsupported entities from the structural input file, 
and to then randomize a well-defined set of degrees of freedom (<a href="keywords.html#RANDOMIZE">details</a>).
The switch from using <a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">FMCSC_PDBFILE</a> to
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_TEMPLATE">FMCSC_PDB_TEMPLATE</a> is what enables this. This implies that
the supported residues are built in their well-defined covalent geometries in the same way as if
no structural input file was present. Since nonbonded interactions are now in use,
we will select settings consistent with the final model we have in mind (the ABSINTH implicit solvent model).
In addition, we want a cutoff treatment in place.<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#INTERMODEL">FMCSC_INTERMODEL</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SIGRULE">FMCSC_SIGRULE</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#EPSRULE">FMCSC_EPSRULE</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CUTOFFMODE">FMCSC_CUTOFFMODE</a> 4<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NBCUTOFF">FMCSC_NBCUTOFF</a> 12.<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ELCUTOFF">FMCSC_ELCUTOFF</a> 12.<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Lastly, we are not interested in all types of analyses enabled by default at this point, which means that
some of them are going to be disabled:<br/>
<br/>

In this first step, we want to assess how the sampler is working, and for this purpose internal
coordinate statistics are generated, both instantaneously and in histogram form. Additionally,
we monitor the evolution of individual terms to the potential energy. Execute:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial12.key &gt;&amp;mctest.log<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
For the given <a href="keywords.html#TOROUT">output mode</a>, the file with instantaneous 
torsion angles (<a href="outputfiles.html#FYC.dat">FYC.dat</a>) lists all those torsional degrees 
of freedom that are natively supported by CAMPARI. If you inspect the file, it becomes apparent
that we do not yet sample the &phi;/&psi; angles in the peptide (except for one &psi; angle,
which has a very technical reason not elaborated upon here) or the sugar pucker in ADP.
None of these degrees of freedom are accessible to the current sampler, which means we have to extend/alter the move set:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#NUCFREQ">FMCSC_NUCFREQ</a> 0.2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SUGARFREQ">FMCSC_SUGARFREQ</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SUGARRDFREQ">FMCSC_SUGARRDFREQ</a> 0.2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#OTHERFREQ">FMCSC_OTHERFREQ</a> 0.6<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Sugar pucker moves are part of a different branch of the move type decision tree, which mandates
that <a href="keywords.html#NUCFREQ">FMCSC_NUCFREQ</a> is nonzero. The reduction in the value for
<a href="keywords.html#OTHERFREQ">FMCSC_OTHERFREQ</a> achieves that the default move type
is included (polypeptide backbone &phi;/&psi; pivot moves). Execute again:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial12.key &gt;&amp;mctest.log<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Inspecting <a href="outputfiles.html#FYC.dat">FYC.dat</a>, it becomes apparent that all the desired
degrees of freedom are now indeed sampled. Furthermore, instantaneous energy values in
<a href="outputfiles.html#ENERGY.dat">ENERGY.dat</a> reveal that the system does not appear to
suffer from any major sources of energetic frustration. This means that we are now ready to prepare the system
for simulations with a realistic Hamiltonian.<br/>

<h5>Step 3 - Setting up the system for the ABSINTH implicit solvation model</h5>
The full Hamiltonian has two missing ingredients, <i>viz</i>., partial charges and
the setup of solvation groups for the <a href="keywords.html#SC_IMPSOLV">ABSINTH DMFI</a>.
For the former, inspect the corresponding <a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.cpi">patch file</a>. The patch accomplishes that
the atoms having been assigned new biotypes receive an explicit partial charge, and that 
the partial charges on the terminal phosphate are slightly modified to produce the correct net
charge on both nucleotide residues.<br/>
For the setup of the ABSINTH DMFI, we have to take a few more things into account. It appears 
reasonable to decompose the hydroxyamine in both the small molecule and the peptide into 
two groups each (NH<sub>3</sub> and OH), whereas the additional phosphate should 
constitute its own solvation group. Solvation groups across residue boundaries may be compromised
by the presence of unsupported residues, and we will (re)assign them explicitly to be safe.
The decomposition strategy of the ABSINTH model may not always be obvious, and it can be useful
to first look at how it works for the supported residues. Append the key-file as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_POLAR">FMCSC_SC_POLAR</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_IMPSOLV">FMCSC_SC_IMPSOLV</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_ATTLJ">FMCSC_SC_ATTLJ</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#FOSREPORT">FMCSC_FOSREPORT</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CPATCHFILE">FMCSC_CPATCHFILE</a> tutorial12.cpi<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The report flag will ensure that we obtain a diagnostic output file named <a href="outputfiles.html#FOS_GROUPS.vmd">FOS_GROUPS.vmd</a>.
Execute:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial12.key &gt;&amp;absinthmc.log<br/>
vmd -e FOS_GROUPS.vmd<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The simulation will take longer than the excluded volume calculation above due to the much more complex energy function.
In the visualization of solvation groups (for every residue, the different solvation groups are 
shown as transparent envelopes to the relevant atoms always using the same color sequence of 
the VMD default starting at "1" for "ColorID"), you will note that the 5'-phosphate and the
small molecules have no groups set up. Conversely, the hydroxylysine residue is already
set up with a standard backbone amide solvation group because it is identified as a proper polypeptide residue.
If you now inspect the <a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.fos">DMFI patch file</a>, whose format
is explained <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_FOSPATCHFILE">elsewhere</a>, you can see that we set up a total
of 6 additional solvation groups. The 5'-phosphate is actually realized as a sum of two contributions
(OH <i>vs</i>. OPO<sup>-</sup>). The reference free energy of solvation for the group carrying the net negative charge
is -100 kcal/mol, <i>i.e.</i>, it is decreased (more negative) in the same way as is normal for charged moieties on
polymers in the published ABSINTH model. Still, the value is unlikely to be appropriate given that the diphosphate
has characteristics of a divalent anion (rather than that of two distinct monovalent, anionic functionalities) with
typical free energies of solvation closer to -250kcal/mol (<i>i.e.</i>, values do not scale linearly with ion valence).
As mentioned in the preface, the process of parameterization is not part of this tutorial, and values are assigned by analogy 
and without any amount of careful thought. The patch also shows that the hydroxyamine is split identically in both cases.
Note that we use uneven atom weights for the primary amines. These weights (third column) are generally not expected
to have much influence because the solvation states of nearby atoms will be highly correlated (this is no longer true if solvation
groups are very large or if <a href="keywords.html#SAVPROBE">the assumed solvation shell thickness</a> is
reduced). The standard ABSINTH convention is to always use equal weights for all atoms in a solvation group.
It is important to realize that in ABSINTH additivity of solvation groups holds at all levels, <i>i.e.</i> it is possible
to subdivide a solvation group corresponding to a small molecule with a reference free energy that is known experimentally further.
As long as the net total for all constituent groups reproduces the reference number, the fully solvated
and fully desolvated reference states continue to be well-defined (this is used, for example, for the adenine base).
More details are provided  <a href="parameters.html#S4_Free_energies_of_solvation">elsewhere</a>.<br/>
The output in "absinthmc.log" also tells you details of the solvation model including the important
piece of information that most parameters are set to match the published model by default
(note that we have set them explicitly in all prior tutorials using the ABSINTH model). However, there is
one crucial error and that is the setting for the <a href="keywords.html#ELECMODEL">short-range electrostatic interaction model</a>.
To fix this error and to enable the patch, append the key-file:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#FOSPATCHFILE">FMCSC_FOSPATCHFILE</a> tutorial12.fos<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ELECMODEL">FMCSC_ELECMODEL</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#INTERMODEL">FMCSC_INTERMODEL</a> 1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
It is highly recommended to specify explicit settings for <a href="keywords.html#ELECMODEL">FMCSC_ELECMODEL</a>
and <a href="keywords.html#INTERMODEL">FMCSC_INTERMODEL</a> in every CAMPARI key-file you use
for actual simulations. Now re-run:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial12.key &gt;&amp;absinthmc.log<br/>
vmd -e FOS_GROUPS.vmd<br/>
mv yourcalc_END.pdb tutorial12_eq.pdb<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The visualization of the solvation groups should reveal quickly that the patch works as intended. This information
is also reported in detail in "absinthmc.log." The final structure serves as the starting point for the production run.<br/>
<h5>Step 4 - Performing and analyzing a brief production simulation</h5>
There are a few additional warnings in "absinthmc.log" that we need to take into account. The first relevant 
one pertains to the simplified computation of additional atom-level parameters for the solvation model
(adjustable by <a href="keywords.html#SAVPATCHFILE">a separate patch</a>). We make no further adjustments here,
but it is worthwhile to keep in mind that for this approach the input geometry should ideally reproduce a state of maximum solvent accessibility
for each rigid fragment yielded by the solvation group decomposition. The second group of interesting warnings is
related to non-spherical symmetries of the cutoff scheme in conjunction with a periodic box, and we will adjust this
by switching to a droplet boundary condition. Change existing or add missing keywords as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#SIZE">FMCSC_SIZE</a> 35.<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ORIGIN">FMCSC_ORIGIN</a> 20. 20. 20.<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> 6000000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#EQUIL">FMCSC_EQUIL</a> 1000000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SHAPE">FMCSC_SHAPE</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#BOUNDARY">FMCSC_BOUNDARY</a> 4<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SOFTWALL">FMCSC_SOFTWALL</a> 0.1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#RANDOMIZE">FMCSC_RANDOMIZE</a> 0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">FMCSC_PDBFILE</a> tutorial12_eq.pdb<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
By the above, we also increase simulation length to a level that will allow making statements of 
statistical relevance for a system of this size. The change to "tutorial12_eq.pdb" as structural input
implies that topology continues to be inferred from the file passed to keyword <a href="keywords.html#PDB_TEMPLATE">FMCSC_PDB_TEMPLATE</a>,
<i>i.e.</i>, "tutorial12_minim.pdb." When working with unsupported residues, it is important not to 
change the template between runs, because some of the parameters may depend on the initial geometry (meaning that 
data could not be explicitly reproducible for runs with different initial conditions). The change to 
<a href="keywords.html#RANDOMIZE">FMCSC_RANDOMIZE</a> is required to make sure that the simulation does indeed
start from the arrangement in "tutorial12_eq.pdb."
Visualization of "tutorial12_eq.pdb" may reveal that an ionic cluster has formed. This is not unexpected for this system,
but the details may of course differ from run to run. Part of the reason for this behavior could be an absence of counterions
providing screening, and there is a warning in this regard in "absinthmc.log". Insert the following into the local copy of "tutorial12.in" 
(just before the line saying "END"):<br/>

</tt>
<br/>
We will use CAMPARI's ability to generate initial positions for these ions automatically without editing "tutorial12_eq.pdb."
Because the ionic interactions can create a very rugged energy landscape, Monte Carlo algorithms alone may not be efficient
at sampling this system. We therefore use a hybrid scheme, in which the focus of the Monte Carlo moves is on large-scale rigid body motion
 and on the sugar sampling. Change existing keywords:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#DYNAMICS">FMCSC_DYNAMICS</a> 5<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NUCFREQ">FMCSC_NUCFREQ</a> 1.0<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
And append the key-file:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#TSTAT_TAU">FMCSC_TMD_TSTAT_TAU</a> 5.<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TMD_INTEGRATOR">FMCSC_TMD_INTEGRATOR</a> 1<br/>

<a href="keywords.html#TIMESTEP">FMCSC_TIMESTEP</a> 0.005<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The above keywords define the sampling engine for the (Newtonian) dynamics in mixed rigid body and dihedral angle coordinate space.
Specifically, we use the <a href="keywords.html#TSTAT">default thermostat</a> (<a href="references.html#ref12_3">Bussi <i>et al</i>.</a>)
with a coupling time of 5ps, and instruct CAMPARI to sample all dihedral angles including those in unsupported residues
(the setting for <a href="keywords.html#TMD_UNKMODE">FMCSC_TMD_UNKMODE</a>). The other keywords are not discussed here. Our last concern
is what data to collect from the production run. Ideally, one would save all information at every snapshot, but 
in reality storage requirements and the ease of data processing and analysis mean that we need to have at least a vague idea beforehand what
we are going to look for. Here, the molecules are so small that we focus our analysis on contact formation between the various species.
Change and or append the key-file:<br/>

</tt>
<br/>
Note that <a href="keywords.html#CLUSTERCALC">FMCSC_CLUSTERCALC</a> refers to the analysis of spatial clusters of molecules, and 
must not be confused with the much more complex functionality controlled by <a href="keywords.html#CCOLLECT">FMCSC_CCOLLECT</a>
(see <a href="tutorial11.html">Tutorial 11</a>). We are only interested in the minimum distance criterion for a contact
(threshold set by <a href="keywords.html#CONTACTMIN">FMCSC_CONTACTMIN</a>), which is why the other threshold is unreasonably small.
The <a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.agp">analysis group file</a> is needed to include the small molecule and the ions in
the contact analysis. We have also disabled or reduced some instantaneous output. This brings us to the production simulation. If
you have compiled an MPI version, run:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
mpirun -np [NP] campari_mpi -k tutorial12.key &gt;&amp;mpi.log<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Here, [NP] should be a number of processes you can use comfortably on the architecture at hand
(<i>e.g.</i>, 3 for a desktop with a 4-core CPU). By adding the keyword <a href="keywords.html#MPIAVG">FMCSC_MPIAVG</a>,
we have asked CAMPARI to perform a run consisting of multiple independent copies of the same simulation with
automatic data collection from all replicas at the end (to increase statistics). With just the serial version, run instead:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial12.key &gt;&amp;production.log<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
It is possible that this simulation will fail. When working with molecular dynamics, we have to keep in mind the
fastest degrees of freedom in relation to the chosen integration time step of 5fs. Here, our system features
several hydroxyl groups, which are associated with very low effective mass. If the terminal hydrogen atoms 
encounter a hard potential (<i>e.g.</i>, contact with another atom or the droplet boundary), their velocity 
may increase catastrophically. This erroneous heat is normally dissipated to other degrees of freedom, which
eventually causes the simulation crash. Note that the crash behavior is stochastic because our system is dilute
(heterogeneous levels of energetic coupling) and the coordinate representation is nonuniform. 
In case of a crash, append the key-file with:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#MPATCHFILE">FMCSC_MPATCHFILE</a> tutorial12.mpi<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
<a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.mpi">This patch file</a>
increases hydrogen mass for the atoms in question to 3 Da. Start a new simulation using
the same command as above.<br/>
Once completed successfully, we can turn to the analysis. You should first check the output written to
the MPI log-files (N_000.log, N_001.log, and so on) or to "production.log" (if run in serial mode) after
the actual simulation steps have finished. There is useful information regarding sampling
and ensemble statistics that can help diagnose the basic soundness of our approach. For example, the 
average temperatures for individual degrees of freedom should be close to the target ensemble temperature of 300K
(if all or some are not, this could indicate a simulation that was at least partially unstable).
By not saving any coordinates, the types of analyses we can perform are of course restricted to the output
we requested. The tutorial is accompanied by an <a href="../examples/tutorial12/tutorial12.R">R-file</a> that
helps visualizing the contact map. We expect that the ADP molecule will probably be associated with two monovalent
cations for most of the time. Due to the additional associativity resulting from the presence of other groups, it
is likely that the hydroxylysine residue in the peptide is one of these. 
Open R and execute:<br/>
<br/><tt>
source("tutorial12.R")<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The resultant plot is likely to reveal that the peptide and ADP associate strongly. We use a minimum distance criterion
of 5&#8491; to identify contacts, and thresholds of this type can always lead to misinterpretation of data. 
For the specific example here, we have to keep the overall spatial proximity in mind, <i>i.e.</i>, many contacts are 
indirect symptoms of other contacts and must not be misinterpreted as causative (and causal relationships 
will generally be impossible to discern from an equilibrium simulation at a single condition). The contact map
may reveal sporadic contacts of potassium ions to ADP. You should also have a look at output file
<a href="outputfiles.html#MOLCLUSTERS.dat">MOLCLUSTERS.dat</a>. Here, each row corresponds to probabilities
per molecule to be part of a solute cluster of the given size. This file should point out that ADP and the peptide
are never in isolation. However, these data do also rely on the setting for <a href="keywords.html#CONTACTMIN">FMCSC_CONTACTMIN</a>.<br/>
There are a few things you could try as follow-ups to this tutorial. The first is to figure out how to make the simulation use resources
more efficiently (balance of Monte Carlo move set, balance of Monte Carlo vs. dynamics). This should involve
an assessment of the appropriateness of sampling on a small subset of degrees of freedom with Monte Carlo
(output in <a href="outputfiles.html#INTHISTS_DI.dat">INTHISTS_DI.dat</a> may reveal unwanted initial state biases).
The second is to change the simulation settings such that trajectory output is written. As noted above, simulation analysis requires
some prior knowledge to inform choices, and the setting for <a href="keywords.html#CONTACTMIN">FMCSC_CONTACTMIN</a> is a
good example here. It would certainly be useful to reanalyze an existing trajectory with different values for 
<a href="keywords.html#CONTACTMIN">FMCSC_CONTACTMIN</a>. The third is to think about the parameterization,
in particular the data in the solvation group patch file.
