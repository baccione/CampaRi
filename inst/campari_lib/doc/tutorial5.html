<h2>Tutorial 5: Molecular Dynamics and Water Models - Pair Correlation
Functions in TIP3P and TIP4P Water</h2>
<h3>Preface:</h3>
This example simulates one of the most common test systems imaginable, <i>viz.</i>,
a
box
of water in the canonical (NVT) ensemble. We will test two different
water models: the ubiquitous three-site TIP3P model and the slightly less common
four-site TIP4P model both developed by the Jorgensen
group at Yale (<a href="references.html#ref1_10">references</a>).<br/>
Water is a dense (about 1g·cm<sup>-3</sup>), polar liquid characterized
by high cohesion,
<i>i.e.</i>, very strong intermolecular forces through hydrogen bonds.
It has many unique properties
experimentally that are not touched upon here. So far, all the
tutorials used Monte Carlo simulation
techniques. While in the early days of simulation work it was rather
common to simulate dense
simple liquids using Monte Carlo, it is important to understand that
fundamentally this is close
to the worst-case scenario application for MC due to the complete
coupling of all degrees of freedom
in the system. For more details on this, consult this recent <a
 href="references.html#ref4_2">reference</a>.
Conversely, correlation between degrees of freedom is most naturally
introduced by force-based methods,
such as molecular dynamics. Therefore, we will use this tutorial as an
introduction to the use
of dynamics methods in CAMPARI. Given the simplicity of the system, you
should feel free
to run this as a Monte Carlo simulation as well.<br/>
The structure of liquids is most commonly analyzed by site-site pair
correlation functions. Here,
we will introduce you to CAMPARI's analysis facility and show how to
generate data that is directly
comparable to published reference data for these water models.<br/>
<h3>Step-by-Step:</h3>
<big style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Step 1 -
Set size and determine number of water molecules to be used</big><br/>
<br/>
First, create two empty directories (one for each water model). Let us
assume you start with TIP4P.
Here, we choose a 32.0x32.0x32.0Å periodic, cubic box:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#BOUNDARY">FMCSC_BOUNDARY</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SHAPE">FMCSC_SHAPE</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SIZE">FMCSC_SIZE</a> 32.0 32.0 32.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#BASENAME">FMCSC_BASENAME</a> TIP4P<br/>
<a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_SEQFILE">FMCSC_SEQFILE</a> &lt;full path
to working directory for TIP4P&gt;/T4P.seq<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
You should be able to compute the number of water molecules yourself
with the knowledge that the <i>in silico</i> density
at room temperature is extremely close to 1g·cm<sup>-3</sup> for both
TIP3P and TIP4P. However, remember
that in case the density is only approximately known, it is always
safer to i) use overall larger boxes, and ii)
err in the setup of an NVT simulation on the lower density side (take a
few molecules less). This reduces
the impact of pressure artifacts. Now create two <a
 href="inputfiles.html">sequence files</a> in the respective
directories with the corresponding number of entries for either "T3P"
or "T4P" and both terminated by "END". Call them T3P.seq
and T4P.seq, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<big style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Step 2 -
Define interaction model and cutoff scheme</big><br/>
<br/>
The original TIP3P and TIP4P models are available - for instance -
through the <a href="references.html#ref1_7">OPLS-AA/L</a> parameter file. Therefore,
we can copy and paste straight from the <a href="keywords.html#OPLSAAL">documentation</a>:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a> &lt;full path to
CAMPARI directory&gt;/params/oplsaal.prm<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#INTERMODEL">FMCSC_INTERMODEL</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ELECMODEL">FMCSC_ELECMODEL</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_IPP">FMCSC_SC_IPP</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_ATTLJ">FMCSC_SC_ATTLJ</a> 1.0<br/>

<a href="keywords.html#SIGRULE">FMCSC_SIGRULE</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_POLAR">FMCSC_SC_POLAR</a> 1.0<br/>
<br/>
</tt>
Note that some keywords were dropped that are not directly applicable
to the present example. One tricky
aspect about the use of periodic boundary conditions is that the
interaction model has to be truncated at a specific distance
(less than half the shortest box length, <i>i.e.</i> 16Å in our case).
This is
commonly achieved by a cutoff scheme. The reason lies in the typically
used minimum-image convention, <i>i.e.</i>
the convention that each particle interacts only with a single copy of
another particle present in the actual
simulation cell, but that its copy is chosen as the nearest image. If
the interaction model were truncated at a longer
distance, it would become necessary to compute interactions with
multiple images so as to avoid completely
artificial cutoff asymmetries from occurring:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#CUTOFFMODE">FMCSC_CUTOFFMODE</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NBCUTOFF">FMCSC_NBCUTOFF</a> 12.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ELCUTOFF">FMCSC_ELCUTOFF</a> 12.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#LREL_MD">FMCSC_LREL_MD</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NBL_UP">FMCSC_NBL_UP</a> 5<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#GRIDDIM">FMCSC_GRIDDIM</a> 8 8 8<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#GRIDMAXGPNB">FMCSC_GRIDMAXGPNB</a> 512<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The above instructs CAMPARI to use grid-based cutoffs. During dynamics,
all non-bonded interactions will be truncated
at 12.0Å with electrostatic contributions being "switched" to be
exactly zero at that distance via the
<a href="keywords.html#LREL_MD">reaction-field method</a>. The implied dielectric
of 78.2 (default) is not enough to avoid force discontinuities at the
cutoff distance, however. There is no twin-range (distance regime for interactions
to be computed less frequently) because this technique is not compatible with the reaction-field method.
Grid-based methods are by far the most
common and
efficient way of maintaining <a href="keywords.html#NBL_UP">neighbor lists</a>
during molecular simulations in
dense fluids, and these are what makes cutoffs work efficiently.
One of the results examined in this
tutorial depends on the choice for the <a
 href="keywords.html#ELCUTOFF">overall cutoff</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<big style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Step 3 -
Prepare starting structure</big><br/>
<br/>
The numerical integration of equations of motion relies on the use of
forces that can be extremely large for
conformations with steric overlap. In MC simulations, we do not use
forces, and can start the algorithm from
arbitrary starting conformations. In dynamics, such a protocol would
lead to "explosion" of the simulation
(integration becomes unstable until eventually a critical numerical
overflow error crashes the program). Therefore,
we will first run MC for a while to obtain a pdb file with a
sufficiently equilibrated water box:<br/>

<a href="keywords.html#ENOUT">FMCSC_ENOUT</a> 1000<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
You should be familiar with the move set instructions and general
simulation specifications by now. We also
started adding some keywords that will prevent output not interesting
to us.
After pasting all the above keywords into a file called "water.key",
execute:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k water.key &gt;&amp; log<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This will only take a few minutes. After the run is complete, have a
look at the <a href="outputfiles.html#basename_END.pdb">
final structure snapshot</a> written out by CAMPARI as "TIP4P_END.pdb"
(or "TIP3P_END.pdb", respectively). It should look like a box of water
with homogeneous density and no discernible steric overlaps between
molecules. Rename this
file to "TIP4P_MC.pdb" or "TIP3P_MC.pdb", respectively. It is important 
that energetically this file is relaxed enough to be used as an input
for a gradient-based simulation. If not (consult log-output), repeat or extend
the above MC calculation.<br/>
<br/>
<big style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Step 4 -
Run the molecular dynamics simulation</big><br/>
<br/>
In molecular dynamics, we have to consider additional implementation
issues. In order for the integrated equations
of motion to yield an ensemble other than the microcanonical one (NVE),
we need to introduce a coupling device
to an external bath. These coupling devices and "baths" are
almost always utterly conceptual and may appear
confusing at first. Append the existing "water.key" as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#ENSEMBLE">FMCSC_ENSEMBLE</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#DYNAMICS">FMCSC_DYNAMICS</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TIMESTEP">FMCSC_TIMESTEP</a> 0.004<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TSTAT">FMCSC_TSTAT</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TSTAT_TAU">FMCSC_TSTAT_TAU</a> 1.0<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Here, we specify explicitly the ensemble to be the canonical one,
request Newtonian (rather than stochastic) dynamics,
set a time step of 4fs, and instruct CAMPARI to couple each degree of
freedom individually to an <a href="references.html#ref12_2">Andersen thermostat</a>
(which is a very simple, stochastic thermostat) with a coupling time of
1ps. Note that it is, by default, implied that the
dynamics are performed in rigid-body space (→ <a
 href="keywords.html#CARTINT">FMCSC_CARTINT</a>). This is important
because the use of rigid body degrees of freedom as opposed to
Cartesian degrees of freedom means that we do not have to deal with
keeping the water molecules rigid through other means. The same tutorial could of course be
run in Cartesian space by using <a href="keywords.html#SETTLE_H2O">appropriate constraints</a>
and analytical or iterative solvers (see <a href="keywords.html#SHAKEMETHOD">FMCSC_SHAKEMETHOD</a> for an overview).
The use of constraints is of critical importance since these water models were parameterized
as rigid models using primarily MC simulations
in the early phases of development.
Details of the rigid-body integrator are provided <a href="keywords.html#TMD_INTEGRATOR">elsewhere</a> and will be part
of an <a href="references.html#ref5_16">upcoming publication</a> that uses liquid TIP4P
as one of its reference tests. To improve stability for the challenging case of 
rigid rotation of water (very small inertia), set the following:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#TMD_INTEGRATOR">FMCSC_TMD_INTEGRATOR</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TMD_INT2UP">FMCSC_TMD_INT2UP</a> 4<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
With these settings, the time step could be pushed up to about 5fs for this system
without major losses in accuracy. The dynamics of
the system depend strongly on the <a href="keywords.html#TSTAT_TAU">coupling time of
the Andersen thermostat</a> and are useful as tools for comparison only amongst
identical simulation protocols that are largely identical. We will therefore focus on static
properties in our analysis.<br/>
To proceed, we instruct CAMPARI to use the MC-generated structure as
input, and to perform the necessary analyses on-the-fly:<br/>
<br/>

<a href="keywords.html#CHECKFREQ">FMCSC_CHECKFREQ</a> 100<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Some of these analyses may have been disabled by CAMPARI in any case
(and some more that are not shown definitely are). The
only meaningful things requested by this key-file would be energy
output (<a href="keywords.html#ENOUT">FMCSC_ENOUT</a>),
ensemble output (<a href="keywords.html#ENSOUT">FMCSC_ENSOUT</a>), and
pair correlation analyses (<a href="keywords.html#PCCALC">FMCSC_PCCALC</a>).
The
latter use an <a href="../examples/tutorial5/tutorial5.t4p">input
file</a>
that has <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_PCCODEFILE">different options
for formatting</a>. Here, we take advantage
of the matrix input format (that is perfect for this type of
application) to instruct CAMPARI to collect statistics
on three possible intermolecular site-site correlation functions (O-O,
O-H, H-H).<br/>
Lastly, we of course have to adjust the simulation
length parameters, so <i>change</i> the following keywords that are
already present in "water.key":<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> 1250000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#EQUIL">FMCSC_EQUIL</a> 250000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#RANDOMIZE">FMCSC_RANDOMIZE</a> 0<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
We will simulate for a total of 5ns with the first 1ns being
discarded as equilibration (<i>i.e.,</i> not entering
for instance the pair correlation analysis). We also need to disable any type of initial randomization. Now type:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k water.key &gt;&amp; log2<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The simulation should run for 1-2 days.<br/>
<br/>
<big style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Step 5 -
Analyze the results</big><br/>
<br/>
After the simulation has successfully ended,
first plot the total system potential energy (column 2 in <a
 href="outputfiles.html#ENERGY.dat">ENERGY.dat</a>) as a
function of step number (column 1 in <a
 href="outputfiles.html#ENERGY.dat">ENERGY.dat</a>). The energy should
be
stable (reached a plateau) and there should be symmetric fluctuations
around the mean, <i>i.e.</i>, there should be no spikes, no sudden
drops, <i>etc.</i> Any such behavior
would be indicative of a problem with the simulation itself (bad
settings).
In general, an energy trace is of course a poor way of analyzing a
simulation, but for this homogeneous system it
serves well as a first sanity check. An additional such check would be
to plot the instantaneous system temperature
by plotting column 5 of <a href="outputfiles.html#ENSEMBLE.dat">ENSEMBLE.dat</a>.
System
temperature will almost
always be a direct or indirect reporter on erroneous simulations (you
can also find the average system temperature
over the production portion of the run in the log-file ["log2" above]).<br/>
From the potential energy plot, extract the average system potential
energy and divide it by the number of molecules you specified
in the sequence file. The resultant value, the mean potential energy
per particle, is a typical hallmark quantity
for water models and should under ambient conditions be close to
-10kcal/mol. Note, however, that as hinted at above the precise
value will be dependent on the cutoff settings and the cutoff
implementation and that values listed in the literature are typically
obtained with a particular scheme that is most likely <i>not</i>
identical to the one employed here.
In addition, this is an NVT simulation, for which the actual density
might deviate slightly from the "correct"
density for the water model in question. Still, drastic deviations will
indicate a fundamental flaw in the program or parameters.<br/>
To analyze solution structure, plot the obtained site-site correlation
functions (O-O, O-H,
and H-H) and compare them to published values (see <a
 href="references.html#ref1_12">references</a>).
They can be found in the output file <a
 href="outputfiles.html#GENERAL_PC.dat">GENERAL_PC.dat</a> as columns
2-4 (with the first column indicating distance). Note that these pair
correlation functions (g<sub>OO</sub>(r) and so on)
have been obtained by normalizing raw distance distributions by an
analytical
prior (maximum entropy distribution). This so-called volume element can
normally be found in <a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">RBC_PC.dat</a>,
and
is non-trivial for distances exceeding half
the smallest box length. Here, we did not obtain these data since the
output to <a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">RBC_PC.dat</a>
was completely suppressed given that all water molecules were regarded
as solvent from the default assignment of the <a
 href="keywords.html#ANGRPFILE">analysis group parsing</a>. This could
easily
be remedied of course.<br/>
When comparing to the literature, all prominent short-range features should match the published data
accurately (since these are fairly robust). The most variation can be
expected for the peak heights of sharp peaks (due to variations in the
binning). After you have run both simulation by making the appropriate
modifications above,
TIP3P and TIP4P must be easily distinguishable in g<sub>OO</sub>(r) by
the much more pronounced long-range
features in TIP4P compared to the very flat curve observed for TIP3P.<br/>
Note, however, that two artifacts will be introduced that become visible when plotting the pair correlation
functions out to larger distances. The first will show up mostly in g<sub>OO</sub>(r)
and is a cutoff artifact generated by the reaction-field method (<i>i.e.</i>, it is physically present). You will
note very subtle undulations precisely near the 12.0&#8491; RF cutoff used in this tutorial. The second
are purely numerical artifacts due to the normalization. As discussed 
<a href="outputfiles.html#GENERAL_PC.dat">elsewhere</a>, the analytical volume element assumes that all sites
are completely independent of one another. However, for polyatomic molecules, image shift vectors are determined
not on a per-atom basis, but on a per-residue basis. This leads to artifacts at distances corresponding to
geometrical characteristics of the simulation cell (for a cubic box, at half the side length and
at half the lengths of the two possible diagonals, which includes the distance of maximal separation). These latter artifacts could be
partially eliminated by the use of a numerical prior.<br/>
