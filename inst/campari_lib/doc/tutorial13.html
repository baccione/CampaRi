<h2>Tutorial 13: The Creation of Toy Models, Energy Landscape Sculpting, and Progress Index-Guided Sampling</h2>
<h3>Preface:</h3>
In this tutorial, we present a hands-on approach to the use of two advanced sampling techniques. The first is called
energy landscape sculpting (ELS) within CAMPARI, and the second is "Progress Index-Guided Sampling"
(or PIGS in short). For this, we construct a simple toy model, similar
to the one used in the <a href="refereces.html#ref5_17">PIGS reference publication</a>, which has the additional
benefit of demonstrating the use of some of CAMPARI's less obvious customization options, 
predominantly <a href="keywords.html#FRZFILE">custom constraints</a> and
<a href="keywords.html#SC_TABUL">tabulated potentials</a> (Step 1). We first demonstrate sampling limitations
when using short trajectories obtained with conventional sampling that all start from the same well-defined
reference state (Step 2).<br/>
Energy landscape sculpting, which is a straightforward generalization of the 
<a href="references.html#ref2_21">accelerated molecular dynamics method</a> of Hamelberg <i>et al.</i>,
achieves a sampling benefit by modifying the potential energy landscape, <i>viz.</i>, by decreasing
the absolute depths of minima and maxima of one or more individual terms. It is well-suited
to scenarios where an individual energy term with well-defined bounds provides barriers that
are hindering conformational transitions of interest, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>cis-trans</i> isomerization
of proline residues by means of <a href="keywords.html#SC_BONDED_T">torsional potentials</a>. Conversely,
the PIGS method is based on the idea that multiple identical copies of a system evolving in parallel can be 
directed toward as diverse areas of accessible phase space as possible if data from all copies
are analyzed jointly. The analysis method of choice is the progress index introduced in 
 <a href="tutorial11.html">Tutorial 11</a>. This method has the ability to identify sampling basins
of a system without overlap given a distance metric as input. Consequently, the most critical inputs
for any PIGS simulation are keywords <a href="keywords.html#CDISTANCE">FMCSC_CDISTANCE</a> and
<a href="keywords.html#CFILE">FMCSC_CFILE</a>. The PIGS algorithm is memoryless across multiple stretches,
which means that it does not penalize recurrence to the same places in general. Instead it primarily avoids
multiple copies of the system occupying a given region of phase space. The PIGS method uses no energetic bias
(unlike <a href="keywords.html#SCULPT">energy landscape sculpting</a> or
umbrella sampling on specific reaction coordinates, <i>e.g.</i>, those measuring
<a href="keywords.html#SC_ZSEC">secondary structure content</a> as in <a href="tutorial9.html">Tutorial 9</a>). 
In PIGS, unlike in the <a href="keywords.html#REMC">replica exchange</a> method, all copies propagate
under identical conditions. This property means that PIGS simulations are particularly well-suited for
the exploration of systems with many states separated by relatively small energetic barriers.<br/>
To keep the tutorial fast and tractable, we use a one-dimensional toy model to demonstrate the virtues
of these two methods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Step-by-Step:</h3>
<h5>Step 1 - Definition of a one-dimensional toy model</h5>
First create an empty directory that we will use as the lone working directory for this tutorial.
In order to create a one-dimensional system, we could consider a single particle in an external field. The only
external fields CAMPARI currently supports are the <a href="keywords.html#BOUNDARY">soft-wall boundary conditions</a>
and the <a href="keywords.html#SC_EMICRO">spatial density restraints</a>. Only the latter are externally customizable but
this is not very convenient as the entire technology rests on <a href="keywords.html#EMMAPFILE">3D spatial grids</a>.
Instead we are resorting here to <a href="keywords.html#SC_TABUL">tabulated potentials</a> applied to interatomic distances.
To emulate the one-dimensional case, we will use two particles with one completely frozen and the other restricted
to move in a single dimension. With an arbitrary choice of monoatomic molecule, a sequence file is:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
NA+<br/>
NA+<br/>
END<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Write this file as "toy1D.in". Now let us create a basic key file named "tutorial13.key":<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a> &lt;full path to folder&gt;/campari/params/<a href="keywords.html#OPLSAAL">oplsaal.prm</a><br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SEQFILE">FMCSC_SEQFILE</a> toy1D.in<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_IPP">FMCSC_SC_IPP</a> 0.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SIZE">FMCSC_SIZE</a> 60.<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ORIGIN">FMCSC_ORIGIN</a> 0. 0. 0.<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SHAPE">FMCSC_SHAPE</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#BOUNDARY">FMCSC_BOUNDARY</a> 4<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ENSOUT">FMCSC_ENSOUT</a> 100000000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#RSTOUT">FMCSC_RSTOUT</a> 100000000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ENOUT">FMCSC_ENOUT</a> 100000000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ACCOUT">FMCSC_ACCOUT</a> 100000000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#POLOUT">FMCSC_POLOUT</a> 100000000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SAVCALC">FMCSC_SAVCALC</a> 100000000<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This creates a droplet system with radius 60&#8491; and turns off any nonbonded interactions. The last 6 lines
are to suppress unwanted output below.
In the first step, we obtain a PDB file we will edit by hand. Execute the serial version of CAMPARI as follows
(here and below, as in all other tutorials, you may have to add paths for your executables):<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial13.key &gt; t13_generate.log<br/>
mv yourcalc_END.pdb toy1D.pdb<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Now edit the coordinate section of the two HETATM records in the PDB file "toy1D.pdb" such that the first atom
is placed on the y-axis at a positive y-value of 3.0 and the second atom exactly at the origin.
The resulting lines should look like this:<br/>
<tt><pre>
HETATM    1  NA  NA+     1       0.000   3.000   0.000  1.00  0.00
HETATM    2  NA  NA+     2       0.000   0.000   0.000  1.00  0.00
</pre></tt>
<br/>
Note that the PDB file format is completely fixed, <i>i.e.</i>, any column shift renders the file incorrect.
We here select the y-dimension as the one to use. We thus need to constrain the motion of the first particle 
in the other two dimensions and freeze the second particle entirely. This is possible by a specific
input mode for custom constraints, which addresses constraints individually but does not work for Monte Carlo simulations (yet).
The format, interpretations, and limitations are explained in detail <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_FRZFILE">elsewhere</a>.
To implement our example toy model, the file should look like this:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
A<br/>
1 XZ<br/>
2 XYZ<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Paste this into a file called "toy1D.frz". This concludes the definition of the system.<br/>

<h5>Step 2 - Conventional sampling of the model</h5>
We are now in the position to set up the sampler for our system.
While it is perfectly possible to run PIGS in conjunction with a Monte Carlo engine, we cannot, as mentioned before,
achieve the restriction to a single dimension with custom constraints. Note that for the tutorial to be interesting,
we would also have to restrict the Monte Carlo move set to local steps, which should become clear below.
We thus choose a <a href="inputfiles.html#DYNAMICS">stochastic dynamics</a> sampler, <i>i.e.</i>, a Langevin integrator.
Add the following to the key-file:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#DYNAMICS">FMCSC_DYNAMICS</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CARTINT">FMCSC_CARTINT</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TIMESTEP">FMCSC_TIMESTEP</a> 0.015<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> 10000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#FRICTION">FMCSC_FRICTION</a> 3.<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#FRZFILE">FMCSC_FRZFILE</a> toy1D.frz<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#FRZREPORT">FMCSC_FRZREPORT</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">FMCSC_PDBFILE</a> toy1D.pdb<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This turns on stochastic dynamics in Cartesian space with an intermediate friction value of 3/ps at a time step of 15fs run for
10000 steps (150ps).
It also enables the desired constraints (including a report) and starts the simulation from a structure
consistent with the dimensionality we want to achieve. Execute:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial13.key &gt; t13_test.log<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Reading through the errors printed in the beginning to "t13_test.log" (before the summary portion), you should only
find warnings about unsupported analysis features, which are enabled by default (and which we could adjust explicitly
to avoid these warnings). More importantly, a short report should tell you that the
<a href="inputfiles.html#FRZFILE">constraint input file</a> has most likely been interpreted correctly.<br/>
Our system has only a single degree of freedom, <i>viz.</i>, the y-position of the 2<sup>nd</sup> atom, and
we would like to bias its distribution using a custom potential. We use <a href="keywords.html#SC_TABUL">tabulated potentials</a>
based on interatomic distances for this. CAMPARI will interpolate the potential using cubic Hermite splines.
The potential(s) must be read from file (see <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_TABPOTFILE">here for details</a>) as does
the file used to map potentials to specific interatomic distances (see <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_TABCODEFILE">here for details</a>). The first derivatives can be read from file (see <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_TABTANGFILE">here for details</a>)
or inferred from the potential(s). In this tutorial, we use a potential with 8 states of almost equivalent likelihood,
which is an extremely simple model of a system with a rugged free energy landscape without a main attractor basin.
Copy the file <a href="../examples/tutorial13/tutorial13.tpot">tutorial13.tpot</a> into the current working directory and
plot it to have a better picture of the implied landscape.
Importantly, at the <a href="keywords.html#TEMP">default temperature</a>, the large barriers
at 0.0 and 50.0&#8491; are practically impenetrable. This simplifies our analysis later because it will restrict
the 1<sup>st</sup> particle to positive y-values (given the starting conformation we constructed). The 8 attractors
are more or less evenly spaced (6.25&#8491;) and the 1<sup>st</sup> particle is initially found in the leftmost
one.<br/>
The input file for the potential has only a distance column (in &#8491;) and a single column with the potential
(in kcal/mol). This means that we have to write the following <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_TABCODEFILE">map file</a>
to apply it to the interatomic distance:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
1 1<br/>
1 2 1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Paste this to a file called "toy1D.map". The first line chooses input mode 1 and tells CAMPARI to expect exactly 1 
request. The second line gives the atom indices in question (1 and 2) and the potential to use (by index, 1). If you
have not already done so, copy
the file with the potential, <a href="../examples/tutorial13/tutorial13.tpot">tutorial13.tpot</a> to the current
working directory and then append the key-file as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#SC_TABUL">FMCSC_SC_TABUL</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TABCODEFILE">FMCSC_TABCODEFILE</a> toy1D.map<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TABPOTFILE">FMCSC_TABPOTFILE</a> tutorial13.tpot<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TABREPORT">FMCSC_TABREPORT</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PCCALC">FMCSC_PCCALC</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#INSTGPC">FMCSC_INSTGPC</a> 10<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PCCODEFILE">FMCSC_PCCODEFILE</a> toy1D.map<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#EQUIL">FMCSC_EQUIL</a> 0<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
We right away also begin to monitor our only degree of freedom (with no steps being discarded at the beginning).
This could be done be either post-processing 
<a href="outputfiles.html#Trajectory_output">trajectory output</a> or by monitoring the distance between the 
2 atoms. We choose the latter here. CAMPARI has a versatile utility for <a href="keywords.html#PCCALC">distance analysis</a>
that uses actually the same input functionality as the <a href="inputfiles.html#TABCODEFILE">map file</a> for the tabulated
potentials (keyword <a href="keywords.html#PCCODEFILE">FMCSC_PCCODEFILE</a>). The above keywords request
CAMPARI to collect values of the distance between the two particles every step (<a href="keywords.html#PCCALC">FMCSC_PCCALC</a>)
and to report the instantaneous values every 10 steps in an output file called
<a href="outputfiles.html#GENERAL_DIS.dat">GENERAL_DIS.dat</a> (the spacing of 10 steps is actually obtained
as the value of <a href="keywords.html#PCCALC">FMCSC_PCCALC</a>&#183;<a href="keywords.html#INSTGPC">FMCSC_INSTGPC</a>).
In order to get a histogram that we can compared directly with the exponential of the potential, we require
a further modifications, <i>viz.</i>, we need to work around the fact the CAMPARI will normalize
distance distributions by the 3D volume element (see <a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">details elsewhere</a>),
which we need to multiply back in due to the actual dimensionality being 1.
To achieve this workaround, we need the volume element that is printed to 
<a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">output file RBC_PC.dat</a>, which in turn requires an additional input file:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
T<br/>
1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Paste this to a file called "toy1D.agp". It defines that our only molecule type should be of type "solute", which is
required for some analyses (including the one producing <a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">RBC_PC.dat</a>)
to become available. Of course, in the simple case here, the histograms from our custom distance analysis 
and those in <a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">RBC_PC.dat</a> are the same because we use monoatomic particles.
We can now append the key-file again:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#ANGRPFILE">FMCSC_ANGRPFILE</a> toy1D.agp<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CONTACTCALC">FMCSC_CONTACTCALC</a> 100000000<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This means that we will obtain the pair correlation function as the third column in output file
<a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">RBC_PC.dat</a> (bin centers in the first column).
To recover the raw histogram, we need to multiply the volume element (second column) back in,
<i>e.g.</i>, using the tool "awk" (assuming you are on a Linux system).<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial13.key &gt; t13_serial.log<br/>
awk '{if ((NR &gt; 1) &amp;&amp; ($3 &gt; 0)) print $1,-310.*(8.3145/4184.)*(log($2*$3)-log(0.2))-2.723}' RBC_PC.dat &gt; toy1D.hist <br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Note that the factor of 2.723 is precalculated from the absolute scale of the potential in
 <a href="../examples/tutorial13/tutorial13.tpot">tutorial13.tpot</a> and the bin spacing. The factor of log(0.2) is due to
the bin spacing of <a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">RBC_PC.dat</a>, which is controllable with keyword
<a href="keywords.html#PCBINSIZE">FMCSC_PCBINSIZE</a>. A visual comparison of columns 2 in both "toy1D.hist" and
<a href="../examples/tutorial13/tutorial13.tpot">tutorial13.tpot</a> should reveal a noisy inferred potential 
that is quite unlikely to extend all the way to the largest distances (when the population histogram is zero,
the potential diverges of course). This is a sampling problem, and initial state bias is retained. 
It is left as an exercise to change the simulation to be longer and reanalyze the data to demonstrate eventual
convergence to the expected solution. You should also plot the output in
<a href="outputfiles.html#GENERAL_DIS.dat">GENERAL_DIS.dat</a> once, which highlights the stepwise dynamics
of the particle in jumping between adjacent states.<br/>

<h5>Step 3 - Improved sampling of the model</h5>
If this were not a toy system, the approach to create a single simulation that is long with respect to 
all relevant time scales is very likely unachievable. It is common instead to run multiple copies of the same system
in parallel. It is also common that there is a reference state (<i>e.g.</i>, the crystal structure in simulations
of folded proteins) that all these copies start from, which we mimic here with the leftmost basin.
We resort to the <a href="keywords.html#MPIAVG">MPI averaging mode of CAMPARI</a> to test this, which requires
MPI enabled code (executable campari_mpi, see <a href="install.html">installation instructions</a>).
Add the following to the key-file (and make sure that <a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> is 10000):<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> 10000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MPIAVG">FMCSC_MPIAVG</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#REMC">FMCSC_REMC</a> 0<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Now run (note that you should be able to do this on a Linux desktop even if the system has fewer than 32 cores):<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
mpirun -np 32 campari_mpi -k tutorial13.key &gt; t13_parallel.log<br/>
awk '{if ((NR &gt; 1) &amp;&amp; ($3 &gt; 0)) print $1,-310.*(8.3145/4184.)*(log($2*$3)-log(0.2))-2.723}' RBC_PC.dat &gt; toy1D_MPIx32.hist <br/>
</tt>
<br/>
After completion, first spend some time to inspect the output in N_000.log, especially the part on parallelism. 
In <a href="keywords.html#MPIAVG">MPI averaging mode</a>, CAMPARI will automatically collect data from all replicas,
the number of which is taken directly from the MPI environment ("-np 32") above. We thus have analyzed 32 times as much
data as before. Comparing to the result from the serial run, the new data should show a smoother curve that, however,
does not necessarily manage to extend the range further. This is clear if one considers that the answer is equivalent to an average
across 32 separate executions of the serial case. This is an important result or caveat that often gets lost in simulations
of more complex systems, <i>i.e.</i>, naive parallelism can increase the number of states discovered (phase space coverage)
only in those regions that are kinetically accessible from the starting state. It is left as another exercise to verify that
an average across a large number of runs (whichever way produced) will eventually converge to a well-defined answer that
yields a robust illustration of the remaining initial state bias given the choice for
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a>. It <i>is</i> true that increasing the number of replicas (linearly) increases
the chance of unlikely events occurring. This is a strategy of limited scope, however, as the "unlikely chance" can
be arbitrarily small depending on system and settings. This is particularly troubling if (unlike here) the set of states
with significant equilibrium populations is not known <i>a priori</i>.<br/>
There are many successful strategies to overcome sampling difficulties, and CAMPARI supports several of them. Here, it
would be possible to use pretty much any of them, <i>e.g.</i>, umbrella sampling via <a href="keywords.html#SC_DREST">FMCSC_SC_DREST</a>
or <a href="keywords.html#REMC">replica exchange</a> (see also <a href="tutorial3.html">Tutorial 3</a> and
<a href="tutorial9.html">Tutorial 9</a>). In this tutorial, we will employ two different strategies, one representative
each of two broad classes of simulations. The first class are simulations that extract their sampling benefit from the 
adaptability/selection of the starting conformation such as PIGS (see above and below).
The second class are simulations modifying the potential energy landscape,
and the method termed originally <a href="references.html#ref2_21">"accelerated molecular dynamics"</a> belongs to it.
In CAMPARI, this is implemented in a generalized form. The basic idea is that by knowledge of the potential
energy (or individual terms contributing to it), one can at all times define an analytical transformation that
reduces the depths of minima (attractors) and maxima (barriers). A more detailed overview of the theory is provided
<a href="keywords.html#SCULPT">elsewhere</a>. Add the following to the key-file:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#SCULPT">FMCSC_SCULPT</a> 15<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ELS_FILLS">FMCSC_ELS_FILLS</a> 0.9<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ELS_ALPHA_F">FMCSC_ELS_ALPHA_F</a> 0.5<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ELS_PRINT_WEIGHTS">FMCSC_ELS_PRINT_WEIGHTS</a> 5<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
These keywords enable the method for a specific energy term, <i>i.e.</i>, joint nonbonded energies.
The code for this is 15. We request this term (which here is practically equivalent to the total energy,
which means we could also use code 1) to be sculpted such that any values below 0.9kcal/mol are raised
by a &Delta; that is a buffered difference between the actual and the threshold values (buffer parameter of 0.5kcal/mol). 
Clearly, prior knowledge of the range of energies is required. The last keyword
instructs to CAMPARI to write a file with sampling weights for every 5<sup>th</sup> snapshot.
These weights are theoretically (and here also practically) able to restore Boltzmann
sampling with respect to the original (unsculpted) energy function from the biased distribution generated by the method.
To simplify analysis, also add the following:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#XYZPDB">FMCSC_XYZPDB</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#XYZOUT">FMCSC_XYZOUT</a> 5<br/>

</tt>
<br/>
Now run as before:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
rm N_*.*; mpirun -np 32 campari_mpi -k tutorial13.key &gt; t13_ELS_sim.log<br/>
awk '{if ((NR &gt; 1) &amp;&amp; ($3 &gt; 0)) print $1,-310.*(8.3145/4184.)*(log($2*$3)-log(0.2))-2.723}' RBC_PC.dat &gt; toy1D_ELSx32_biased.hist <br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Plotting the results thus far in the same graph should clearly highlight the flattened landscape 
created by the ELS method. The absence of significant barriers implies that it is now much more 
likely that one or more of these short runs reach the tall barrier at the "right", which is unaffected
by our chosen sculpting. It is illustrative in this regard to plot the output in one or more
of the files named <a href="outputfiles.html#GENERAL_DIS.dat">N_???_GENERAL_DIS.dat</a>.
It is precisely this behavior that gave rise to the moniker "accelerated" in the 
method's title. While the raw distribution is obviously wrong, the weights in
output files <a href="outputfiles.html#ELS_WFRAMES.dat">"N_000_ELS_WFRAMES.dat" and so on</a> are suitable
for correcting it. This reanalysis can not currently be done in parallel, so we concatenate the
output from the previous run:<br/>
<br/>

The key element here is supplying a <a href="keywords.html#FRAMESFILE">file selecting frames for analysis and associating them
with floating point weights</a> for CAMPARI's built-in analysis routines. Note that the file here 
contains all frames in the concatenated pdb trajectory so that the frame selection aspect is
not used. Paste the above into a file called "tutorial13_analysis.key", make the necessary adjustments, and run:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial13_analysis.key &gt; t13_ELS_analysis.log<br/>
awk '{if ((NR &gt; 1) &amp;&amp; ($3 &gt; 0)) print $1,-310.*(8.3145/4184.)*(log($2*$3)-log(0.2))-2.723}' RBC_PC.dat &gt; toy1D_ELSx32_reweighted.hist<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
If you now plot the reweighted data as well, it should be obvious that the sculpting method
has indeed provided a sampling benefit compared to the naive parallel run with the same
resource investment, <i>i.e.</i>, the solution is quite close to the correct one,
the "right end" is almost certainly reached, and the flatness is gone. Some initial state bias 
is retained (tilt toward the left). One attractive feature of the sculpting method is that
it is relatively cheap and can be implemented at a high level. Unfortunately, in high-dimensional
energy landscapes, it is often impossible to sculpt complete energy terms without creating 
extremely heterogeneous sampling weights. These imply that the statistical "size" of the 
reweighted solution will be, unlike in the present example, often negligible.<br/>

<h5>Step 4 - Application of PIGS to the model</h5>
In the last stage of this tutorial, we will apply the PIGS advanced sampling method
to our 1D toy model. As mentioned above, PIGS is part of a class of advanced sampling methods
that create the sampling benefit purely by how initial conditions for (generally short) 
trajectories are selected. The absence of modifications to the energy landscape means
that the only bias present in the final data is initial state bias.
In PIGS, a set of copies evolving in parallel is periodically analyzed by the progress
index algorithm (see <a href="keywords.html#CMODE">FMCSC_CMODE, option 4</a> and 
<a href="tutorial11.html">Tutorial 11</a>) for details.
This analysis yields a decision to terminate one ore more copies in favor of more interesting ones
with the overall goal of eliminating sampling redundancy.<br/>Setting up a PIGS simulation
requires, as the major parameter, a choice of representation, which is trivial here as there is
only one degree of freedom. Much of the setup is shared with that of structural
clustering. First, modify the key-file to disable energy landscape sculpting:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#SCULPT"># FMCSC_SCULPT</a> 15 # when this keyword is not present, the method is disabled<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Next, append the key-file as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#CDISTANCE">FMCSC_CDISTANCE</a> 7 # interatomic distance(s)<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CRADIUS">FMCSC_CRADIUS</a> 0.15<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CMAXRAD">FMCSC_CMAXRAD</a> 20.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CPROGINDRMAX">FMCSC_CPROGINDRMAX</a> 50<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CPROGRDEPTH">FMCSC_CPROGRDEPTH</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MPI_PIGS">FMCSC_MPI_PIGS</a> 1 # enables the method</a><br/>
<a href="keywords.html#REFREQ">FMCSC_REFREQ</a> 500<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CCOLLECT">FMCSC_CCOLLECT</a> 10<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MPI_GOODPIGS">FMCSC_MPI_GOODPIGS</a> 16 # needs to be adjusted if replica number differs</a><br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The first keyword defines the measure of conformational distance (normally, for a meaningful selection,
an extra <a href="keywords.html#CFILE">input file</a> would be required). The next 2 + 2 keywords
set parameters for the purely auxiliary clustering (not discussed further) and control the 
random search methodology for the approximate progress index, respectively.
Finally, the last 4 keywords enable and control the actual PIGS method, which requires
a choice of interval for attempting reseedings (<a href="keywords.html#REFREQ">FMCSC_REFREQ</a>),
a choice of number of copies to declare as "good" or protected in each reseeding attempt 
(<a href="keywords.html#MPI_GOODPIGS">FMCSC_MPI_GODDPIGS</a>), which is often taken
as half of the total number of copies, and a choice for how frequently to collect data from
each copy (<a href="keywords.html#CCOLLECT">FMCSC_CCOLLECT</a>).
With these modifications, run:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
rm N_*.*; mpirun -np 32 campari_mpi -k tutorial13.key &gt; t13_PIGS_sim.log<br/>
awk '{if ((NR &gt; 1) &amp;&amp; ($3 &gt; 0)) print $1,-310.*(8.3145/4184.)*(log($2*$3)-log(0.2))-2.723}' RBC_PC.dat &gt; toy1D_PIGSx32_biased.hist <br/>
cat N_???_*traj.pdb &gt; toy1D_PIGS.pdb<br/>
mv N_000_PIGSTRACE.dat toy1D_PIGS.trace<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
By comparing the PIGS-generated distribution to the reference solution in
<a href="../examples/tutorial13/tutorial13.tpot">tutorial13.tpot</a>, it should become
clear that PIGS by itself approximates the correct distribution quite well. Repeated executions
of the above commands should also demonstrate that it is very reliable in finding the rightmost states.
In comparison to energy landscape sculpting, it emerges that PIGS creates no discernible
overpopulation of barrier regions, which is despite the fact that there are only 8 well-defined
states but 32 copies (meaning some overlap in the sampling domains of individual copies is
inevitable). Because PIGS strives to minimize sampling redundancy, the system with 8 states
of equivalent weights is of course a favorable scenario in terms of bias. In general, the initial
state bias incurred by PIGS will be more significant. The PIGS results depend on the chosen
parameters of course. While the metric of distance is fixed here, you should try to change the 
settings for <a href="keywords.html#REFREQ">the reseeding interval</a>, the 
<a href="keywords.html#MPI_GOODPIGS">number of protected replicas</a>, and 
<a href="keywords.html#CCOLLECT">the data collection frequency</a>. For example, a PIGS run can 
approximate or emulate the naive parallelism from above by appropriate changes in
all 3 parameters.<br/>
As we saw above and expected by definition, initial state bias cannot be removed by energetic (Boltzmann) reweighting.
These types of biases are notoriously difficult to address, and one of the few potentially 
general strategies rests in Markov state (network) models. Without going into any details
(see <a href="references.html#ref23_19">literature examples for details</a>), we will apply this
framework to the PIGS data set generated above. To create the model, calculate its equilibrium
population (steady states), and print out snapshot weights, add the following to the 
file "tutorial13_analysis.key":<br/>

<br/>
In addition, edit two lines to the following:<br/>

</tt>
<br/>
The first 4 added keywords provide the metric and clustering settings as before (for the actual PIGS production).
We choose a relatively coarse radius
here (2.5&#8491;), which is due to the requirement of obtaining a reasonably converged transition matrix. It means that
the reweighting, which is at the resolution of network nodes (clusters), will have limited resolution as well. A PIGS
simulation heuristically terminates some copies at well-defined points and reseeds them with configurations from other
copies. This leads to a rerouting of snapshot connectivity in the trajectory files that needs to be corrected for when
constructing a conformational space network (transition matrix) from the data. This is done by the next 4 keywords.
Keyword <a href="keywords.html#CLAGT_MSM">CLAGT_MSM</a>
sets the assumed lag time (implies a sliding window interpretation of the data) for the transition
network inference. It is important that the lag time is not too short (in which case the Markov assumption likely breaks
down) nor too long (in which case sampling quality on the transition matrix deteriorates as most observed transitions are
discarded). Lastly, keyword <a href="keywords.html#CREWEIGHT">FMCSC_CREWEIGHT</a> instructs CAMPARI to 
use an iterative algorithm to compute the Markov state model's steady state given the requested settings.
This could also be done with <a href="keywords.html#EIGVAL_MD">linear algebra routines</a>
assuming CAMPARI was linked to the <a href="install.html">HSL library</a>. For diagnosing the "validity" of the model,
the literature is rich with suggestions, heuristic tests, and error analyses none of which are explored here.
Run:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial13_analysis.key &gt; t13_MSM.log<br/>
mv yourcalc_FWD.fwts toy1D_PIGS.fwts<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
It is recommended to take some time to inspect the output in "t13_MSM.log", which documents the clustering results
and the subsequent analysis. In particular, you should take note of the number of clusters (should be around 20), 
and the reported "network imbalance measure", which gives an indication of how far away from meeting the
detailed balance condition the inferred network is. Detailed balance is a good indicator of sampling quality
as it mandates that each and every pairwise transition that was observed in at least one direction is sampled
such that <i>t<sub>ij</sub>&pi;<sub>i</i> is equal to <i>t<sub>ji</sub>&pi;<sub>j</i> where <i>t</i> are transition matrix elements
(conditional transition probabilities) and <i>&pi;</i> steady state (equilibrium) probabilities.
CAMPARI automatically writes a <a href="outputfiles.html#basename_yyy.fwts">file with snapshot probabilities</a>
(which are the ratios of steady state
populations and raw sampling of the clusters the respective snapshots belong to). It is identical
in format to the <a href="outputfiles.html#ELS_WFRAMES.dat">ELS output file</a> we used before.<br/>
To conclude the tutorial, we need to redo the distance analysis with the calculated weights per snapshot.
Edit two lines in the analysis key-file as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#FRAMESFILE">FMCSC_FRAMESFILE</a> toy1D_PIGS.fwts<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CCOLLECT">FMCSC_CCOLLECT</a> 10000000 # disable this analysis<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
And finally run:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k tutorial13_analysis.key &gt; t13_PIGS_analysis.log<br/>
awk '{if ((NR &gt; 1) &amp;&amp; ($3 &gt; 0)) print $1,-310.*(8.3145/4184.)*(log($2*$3)-log(0.2))-2.723}' RBC_PC.dat &gt; toy1D_PIGSx32_reweighted.hist<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
A comparison of the reweighted and biased PIGS distributions should highlight that the Markov model steady state
reweighting is able to recognize that the rightmost state(s) is/are undersampled in the original (biased) data set
because of a bias of initial conditions originating from the choice of reference state. The correction may not be 
quantitatively accurate, however. It is important to realize
that this procedure is very fragile. Here, we use the <a href="keywords.html#TMAT_MD">forward time</a> matrix
with a specific <a href="keywords.html#CLAGT_MSM">lag time</a> and
<a href="keywords.html#CRADIUS">clustering resolution</a>. It is left as an exercise to demonstrate
that a very large number of alternative settings will not produce a meaningful correction. There are a number
of (coupled) reasons for this, but most of them ultimately reduced to a sampling problem at the
level of the transition matrix.<br/>
A final comparison of all the (at least) 6 answers obtained in this tutorial, <i>viz.</i> from a single replica, from a naive of use of 32 copies,
from ELS with 32 copies (biased and Boltzmann-reweighted), and lastly from PIGS (biased and Markov model-reweighted),
to the correct solution in should illustrate that both advanced sampling methods provide a benefit for this system given an investment
of essentially identical resources, and that energetic biases are more easily removed than initial state biases.
While the one-dimensional potential is a terrible model in many respects, it does highlight that the initial
state matters, and that the ability to find new states depends on barrier heights, on random chance, and on
"distance" from this initial state. Many simulations feature a reference state as an inevitable prerequisite, <i>e.g.</i>,
simulations of folded proteins. In such a scenario, it is thus extremely difficult to assert that states relevant
at the simulations conditions have been sampled exhaustively and that their relative weights have converged.<br/>
