<h2>Tutorial 8: A Very Brief Introduction to Minimizations in Rigid-Body
/ Torsional Space</h2>
<h3>Preface:</h3>
Given a potential energy landscape and a starting conformation for a high-dimensional system,
minimization attempts to steer the system toward nearby minima on that landscape. This is often used to relax
high energy starting structures, with the relaxed structures then being used as input for
molecular dynamics simulations. You may have been surprised to find that in the previous three
tutorials we circumvented the issue of minimization altogether by using a combination
of different methods. This mini-tutorial attempts to show how you could replace
one of the setup steps in those tutorials with a minimization run.<br/>
Before we start, there are a few general points to consider:<br/>
<ol type="A">
<li>Typically, minimization occurs in Cartesian space, and the enforcement of constraints
is often possible only when the simplest minimizer (steepest descent) is used. CAMPARI
offers minimization in Cartesian space if no <a href="keywords.html#SHAKESET">holonomic constraints</a>
are in use. Often, it is more appropriate to pose the minimization problem entirely in rigid-body/torsional space,
and the reader is referred to the documentation for what difficulties this poses from a theoretical point
of view (&rarr; <a href="keywords.html#MINI_MODE">FMCSC_MINI_MODE</a>). The benefit obviously
lies in the fact that constraints such as the rigidity of water molecules are innate to the algorithm.</li>
<li>In dilute systems (including those obtained with a continuum model of solvation), the
energy landscape is often too flat. Explicit particles at high density would introduce 
pronounced ruggedness that almost always guarantees that nearby minima exist whereas in dilute
systems particles relax along a very smooth gradient. This means that well-defined minima are often not found
at all, or are very far away from the starting structure, which makes the procedure inefficient
and difficult to interpret. Of course, it is still possible to relax locally resolvable conflicts 
(such as most steric conflicts) quickly for such systems.</li>
<li>Minimizers are typically not meant and designed to find special classes of local minima, in particular not
the global minimum. Given finite step sizes and numerical issues, this unfortunately means
that there are almost no guarantees whatsoever about the accuracy of parsing the local
environment. In detail, shallow and small minima may be easily missed, and the final
result may depend on the algorithm used. Rigorous energy landscape exploration will therefore
require a sound understanding of the numerical implementation of different minimizers.</li>
<li>For global minimum searches, CAMPARI offers an annealing-type method
(option 4 to <a href="keywords.html#MINI_MODE">FMCSC_MINI_MODE</a>) that differs
fundamentally from the other minimizers. This method is not discussed further in this tutorial.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h3>Step-by-Step:</h3>
<h5>Step 1 - Switching to minimization</h5>
Here we will modify an existing key-file
in such a way that it will allow us to run a basic minimization on
one of the structures generated in any of the previous three tutorials. These are suitable
as those simulations employed explicit solvent (see comments above). Let us
assume you completed <a href="tutorial5.html">tutorial #5</a>. Simply take
the key-file that you used to start your last production run and copy it
and any auxiliary files into a fresh directory. Most importantly,
you should have a pdb file of a reasonably overlap-free conformation. Then, change the
existing keyword determining the sampling method as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt> 
<a href="keywords.html#DYNAMICS">FMCSC_DYNAMICS</a> 6<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CHECKFREQ">FMCSC_CHECKFREQ</a> 10<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
You could attempt to run this immediately without setting any further options. Additional
modifications to the key-file and to the commands below may be needed if you decided
to work with a different tutorial as template (importantly, <a href="keywords.html#RANDOMIZE">randomization</a>
must be completely turned off). Run:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k water.key &gt;&amp; log1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Look at the growing output in "log1" as the simulation is running. Every 10 steps
(requested by <a href="keywords.html#CHECKFREQ">FMCSC_CHECKFREQ</a>), CAMPARI will print out 
current statistics concerning minimization progress. Unless you started from a structure
still containing large steric overlaps, this run should finish before too long by
reaching the gradient RMS convergence criterion (sometimes even in fewer than 10 steps).
You may note that the changes in energy along 10 steps still seemed large. This is due
to the large convergence criterion set by default.<br/>
<h5>Step 2 - Tuning steepest-descent</h5>
If you consult "log1", you will also be able to find information on which minimizer
CAMPARI used. The default one is steepest-descent. Five parameters will be listed in 
the same log-file, and they can be controlled through the key-file as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt> 
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_MODE">FMCSC_MINI_MODE</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_GRMS">FMCSC_MINI_GRMS</a> 0.02<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_STEPSIZE</a> 0.1 <br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE</a> 0.1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_ROT_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_ROT_STEPSIZE</a> 0.5<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_INT_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_INT_STEPSIZE</a> 0.5<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The <a href="keywords.html#MINI_GRMS">gradient convergence criterion</a> is
what made the previous run terminate so quickly. It is given in kcal/mol
because all gradients used are unit-normalized, and we reduce it now to 0.02 kcal/mol.
The last three keywords are base step sizes in units of &#8491; (for rigid-body translation
&rarr; <a href="keywords.html#MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE</a>)
and degrees, respectively (for rigid-body rotation and dihedral angles
&rarr; <a href="keywords.html#MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_ROT_STEPSIZE</a> and
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_INT_STEPSIZE</a>). They
constitute "base" step sizes because CAMPARI will - irrespective of algorithm - 
use a dynamic step size protocol to make minimization efficient. This is required
due to the heterogeneity between different degrees of freedom in rigid-body / torsional
space (not really an issue if you do this for a simple box of water). Part of this
dynamic nature comes in through the outside scaling factor
given by <a href="keywords.html#MINI_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_STEPSIZE</a>. It 
has formal units of mol/kcal, and we pick 0.01 mol/kcal above. This factor
is basically what is changed dynamically (except when using the BFGS method).
This means that the primary point of user control is to change the relative step sizes
with which different classes of degrees of freedom are propagated. We left the
three corresponding keywords (<a href="keywords.html#MINI_INT_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_INT_STEPSIZE</a>
is not applicable to the water box example anyway) at default values. After
appending the key-file with the keywords above, execute again:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k water.key &gt;&amp; log2<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
You should note that this run takes longer due to the much more stringent
convergence criterion. Next modify the key-file as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt> 
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE</a> 0.3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_ROT_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_ROT_STEPSIZE</a> 0.3<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
These modifications make the base increment for rigid-body translation very large compared to that
for rigid-body rotation. Do again:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k water.key &gt;&amp; log3<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
If you compare the output in "log2" and "log3", you should note that the run performed
last progressed much slower down the gradient (ideally, plot the respective potential
energy traces). This is because of the less adequate combination
of translational and rotational base step sizes. As one last illustration, modify the key-file
as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt> 
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_STEPSIZE</a> 0.02<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_XYZ_STEPSIZE</a> 0.1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_ROT_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_ROT_STEPSIZE</a> 0.5<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Here, we scale down the outside step size scale by a factor of 5:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k water.key &gt;&amp; log4<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Due to the dynamic step-scaling, the results here should not be drastically
different from those in "log2" in terms of convergence rate (note, however, that
the scaling factor is needed and used whenever forced step size reductions 
due to overstepping occur; it is therefore not at all trivial to rigorously predict the
impact of the choice for <a href="keywords.html#MINI_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_STEPSIZE</a>).
<br/>
<h5>Step 3 - More complex minimization techniques</h5>
CAMPARI offers two further minimization algorithms, the conjugate-gradient (CG) method
and a specific implementation of a quasi-Newton technique (BFGS). Conjugate-gradient
minimization uses the same parameters as steepest-descent. Modifying the key-file
accordingly is therefore trivial:<br/>
<br/>
<tt> 
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_MODE">FMCSC_MINI_MODE</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_STEPSIZE</a> 0.1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Note that we reset the outside scale factor for step sizes to 0.1 mol/kcal.
Run again:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k water.key &gt;&amp; log5<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
You will note that the reported values for the RMS gradient are qualitatively different 
for similar values of the potential energy indicating that the system is moving along a different path.
You may also note that - while initially slower than steepest-descent - the rate
of minimization in energetic terms quickly becomes faster in this case than for the run
reported in "log2". Lastly, the CG run will probably find a much lower minimum than the
previous runs such that total running times will not be directly comparable.<br/>
The BFGS method attempts to compute and maintain a numerical estimate of the Hessian for
the current position on the landscape. This in itself should clarify that the success
of the method will be parameter- and system-dependent since an inaccurate estimate of the
Hessian will actually impede minimization. The BFGS method introduces two new parameters,
a tolerance setting for occasionally accepting uphill steps, and a memory length used
to compute the Hessian:<br/>
<br/>
<tt> 
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_MODE">FMCSC_MINI_MODE</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_UPTOL">FMCSC_MINI_UPTOL</a> 0.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#MINI_MEMORY">FMCSC_MINI_MEMORY</a> 10<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
We decide not to accept any uphill propagation and set a memory length of 10 steps. Then run:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k water.key &gt;&amp; log6<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
You will possibly find that for this system the BFGS method is superior to the
alternative methods. This is because the average curvature of the energy landscape
for this dense, polar liquid is very high, and consequently contains much useful information. The opposite
is true in dilute systems where curvature is low, and the BFGS method may easily become
the least efficient of the three minimizers. The BFGS method is also the least stable
of the implemented methods especially if there are dihedral angle degrees of freedom
to consider in addition to rigid-body degrees of freedom (<a href="keywords.html#MINI_INT_STEPSIZE">FMCSC_MINI_INT_STEPSIZE</a>).
The conjugate gradient method (<a href="keywords.html#MINI_MODE">FMCSC_MINI_MODE</a> is 2)
probably offers the best compromise between robustness and efficiency.<br/>
With time to kill, you could attempt two more things. The first would be to play the
game of attempting to find parameters that give you the maximal rate in potential 
energy relaxation over the entire progress trace (as pointed out in the example above, it is quite common
for steepest-descent to be very competitive early on but slow to converge later). The second
would be to compare the <a href="outputfiles.html#basename_END.pdb">final structures</a>
of all the converged runs to each other. Some, but not all, may be mutually consistent
indicating that minimization was robust.<br/>
