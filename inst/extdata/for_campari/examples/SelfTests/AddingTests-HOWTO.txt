How to add additional tests
   $ Id: $

To add a new self-test named FooTest,
1) Create test directory named FooTest
2) Copy all the files necessary to run this test to the test directory
   - the token _ABSINTH_HOME_ will be replaced by the location of the absinth
     installation in any files in the test directory
   - additional replacement tokens can be defined in the TestCases.pl file
3) Create script in the test directory which executes the test, named run_test.sh
4) Create the file DiffFiles.pl in the test directory (use e.g. WaterBox/DiffFiles.pl
   as template).  In it, list all the files which are expected to be identical between
   different test runs, and which will be compared.
5) Add the test directory to TestCases.pl
6) Modify TestDescriptions.txt to describe the new test
7) Run the test with the command,
      ./runSelfTests.pl -cr FooTest
   This will copy (with token replacement) all the files in the test directory
   (FooTest) to the work directory (FooTest/work), and then run the test using
   the run_test.sh command
8) Examine the output.  If it is OK, rename the directory "FooTest/work" to
   "FooTest/standard".  
9) To run a new test and compare it against the "standard" results, do,
      ./runSelfTests.pl -cre FooTest
10) Finally, do not check in the work directory to CVS.
