IMMEDIATE:

remove yline2 fline2 constructs

homogenize use of ISO_FORTRAN_ENV to solve typing issues

extend OpenMP support for missing move types in MC



MID- TO LONG-TERM:

support more options for density restraints, including a user-defined property

adjust movesets such that they explicitly respect chemical crosslinks (CRLK_MODE 2), find a SHAKE-like solution for TMD

make the dipole calculation more meaningful: provide a dipole-dipole coupling map, upper left "as is", lower right
multiplied by contact Heaviside filter. use automatically determined dipole groups.

provide latest OPLS, GROMOS, AMBER-ILDN (and variants thereof) parameter sets

streamline memory use: avoid allocating unneeded arrays wherever possible, interact with OS more

extend support for more ensembles at least for certain cases: NPT should be fairly straightforward, but more thinking needed.

extend dynamics implementation: Nose-Hoover thermostat, manostats (see above), more integrators (e.g., LD to BD).

support stochastic minimizer (annealing) for MPIAVG (hybrid MPI/OpenMP)

implement flux decomposition analysis based on committor probabilities

generalize current Wang-Landau to full metadynamics/WL hybrid with hybrid MPI/OpenMP

support a proper asynchronous NB force calculation employing dynamically sized teams for reciprocal and real space parts in PME (and possibly other elements)

translate OpenMP to OpenACC where feasible to allow GPU support

implement an automatic tool for reconstructing missing loops with EV bias (addition to randomizer)


add both explicit and Marrink-style lipids both in terms of geometry (building) and in terms of parameters

allow domain split into a hydrophobic and an aqueous phase (a la implicit membrane). use transfer free energies into cyclohexane (or construct from water-to-cyclohexane partitioning).
