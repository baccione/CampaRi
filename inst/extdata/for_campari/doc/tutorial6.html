<h2>Tutorial 6: Introduction to Polynucleotides - Setting up and Running a Complex Simulation in CAMPARI</h2>
<h3>Preface:</h3>
In this tutorial we expand upon the simple monomer simulation and look at
systems with multiple molecules and high charge content. CAMPARI 
provides wide support for simulating polynucleotides, and our task here
will be to set up a simulation of a piece of double-stranded DNA (<i>i.e.,</i> two chains)
in a solvent composed of appropriate counterions, and an aqueous solution of a background electrolyte.
Such a system is not suitable for simulation by Monte Carlo methods, and we will
expand the basic control obtained in the previous tutorial over using
molecular dynamics within CAMPARI. We want to simulate a folded form of DNA,
and therefore this tutorial will also require the use of a starting structure.<br/>
The tutorial in itself does not attempt to compute any ensemble averages that
can be compared against other simulation or experimental data. It is therefore
a purely technical tutorial whose outcome will consist in nothing but a stable
simulation that can be visualized by appropriate visualization software such as
<a href="references.html#ref23_9">VMD</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Step-by-Step:</h3>
<big style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Step 1 - Create a pdb-file of folded DNA in CAMPARI naming convention with hydrogens and ions added and crystal waters preserved</big><br/>
<br/>
In the examples directory, we have the <a href="../examples/tutorial6/tutorial6.pdb">pdb-file</a> of the Dickerson dodecamer.
This structure was determined around 1980 by Dickerson and colleagues (<a href="references.html#ref2_8">reference</a>)
by X-ray crystallography. Copy this pdb file to the local working directory.
We first require a sequence file with the appropriate DNA sequence and residue names.
To get this, we use a tool delivered with CAMPARI that does precisely this.<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
&lt;full path to CAMPARI directory&gt;/tools/convert_SEQRES_toseq.sh tutorial6.pdb prep.seq HIE T4E<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This will parse the pdb-file and try to write a sequence file with the name 
"prep.seq" using a default choice of protonoation at the N<sub>&epsilon;</sub> for histidines (not an issue here)
and preserving crystal waters as the TIP4P model adjusted specifically for use with the particle mesh Ewald method
(see below). It also prints a warning that the waters in the pdb-file must be renamed manually.<br/>
In the preparation step, let us now rebuild the hydrogens (which are missing in crystal structures),
and add mobile ions (and electrolyte solution). To do this, we will need to know
the final system dimensions. Here we choose a cubic, periodic box with 60&#8491; side length, which is able
to hold the dodecamer irrespective of tumbling and can also respect requirements for interaction cutoffs
later on. Create a file called "prep.key" and paste the following keywords:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a> &lt;full path to CAMPARI directory&gt;/params/amber03.prm<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SEQFILE">FMCSC_SEQFILE</a> prep.seq<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#BASENAME">FMCSC_BASENAME</a> PREP<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#BOUNDARY">FMCSC_BOUNDARY</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SHAPE">FMCSC_SHAPE</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SIZE">FMCSC_SIZE</a> 60.0 60.0 60.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ORIGIN">FMCSC_ORIGIN</a> -10.0 -15.0 -20.0 # just so that the initial DNA placement is roughly central<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_READMODE">FMCSC_PDB_READMODE</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_HMODE">FMCSC_PDB_HMODE</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_R_CONV">FMCSC_PDB_R_CONV</a> 4<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">FMCSC_PDBFILE</a> tutorial6.pdb<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_OUTPUTSTRING">FMCSC_PDB_OUTPUTSTRING</a> "a6,i5,1x,a4,a1,a3,1x,a1,i4,a1,3x,3f18.10"<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Note that the choice of parameter file is more or less arbitrary at this stage.
Through use of <a href="keywords.html#PDB_R_CONV">FMCSC_PDB_R_CONV</a>, we instruct
CAMPARI to interpret the input pdb as a file written in AMBER-convention, which is 
closest to the pdb convention for nucleotides. In this particular case, they keyword is not
actually needed, but it may be in other scenarios (most issues related to residue and atom naming
are handled automatically and independently of this keyword). The last keyword,
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_OUTPUTSTRING">FMCSC_PDB_OUTPUTSTRING</a>, requests CAMPARI
to write a pdb file with nonstandard format (expanded columns for the coordinates). This is
sometimes useful if we want to reuse pdb files for starting simulations to avoid 
inaccuracies in constrained degrees of freedom. Its downside is that these files are not processed
correctly by molecular visualization programs.<br/>
In each strand the dodecamer has 11 phosphate bridges, and its total charge is therefore -22. 
To also create a background of ~0.5M monovalent salt, we add 87 sodium ions and 65 chloride ions.
Append these to the sequence file, <i>e.g.</i>:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
awk '{if ($1 == "END") {for (k=0;k&lt;87;k++) {printf("NA+\n")} for (k=0;k&lt;65;k++) {printf("CL-\n")} print "END"; exit} else {print}}' prep.seq &gt; tmpseq<br/>
mv tmpseq prep.seq<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
We want to let CAMPARI's internal database and the supplemental randomizer take care of the placement
of the missing bits (rather than doing this by an actual simulation). Thus, we set:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#RANDOMIZE">FMCSC_RANDOMIZE</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#RANDOMATTS">FMCSC_RANDOMATTS</a> 100<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#RANDOMTHRESH">FMCSC_RANDOMTHRESH</a> 0.1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#DISABLE_ANALYSIS">FMCSC_DISABLE_ANALYSIS</a> 1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
By using an extremely stringent <a href="keywords.html#RANDOMTHRESH">threshold</a> for the randomizer,
we can ensure that the initial placement of ions is appropriate in steric terms. Now we are able to run:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k prep.key &gt;&amp; log1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This should take less than a second. Output will be very limited but should contain
the file "PREP_START.pdb" which is the (extended format) pdb-file of the Dickerson dodecamer with added hydrogens, ions, 
and in CAMPARI naming convention. Inspect "log1": toward the end of the summary of the calculation you 
can find information on how many atoms were rebuilt, <i>etc.</i> The beginning contains a number
of warnings relating to precisely these missing atoms. As mentioned elsewhere, CAMPARI differs fundamentally from other simulation
software in that it maintains an internal knowledge of molecular topology for the systems it supports.
For biomolecules, these are mostly derived from high-resolution crystallographic databases coupled
to chemical knowledge and/or implied parameters from other force fields. This involves the ability to rebuild
hydrogen atoms meaningfully (the only problematic cases for this procedure are those where a polar hydrogen atom
is (partially) free to rotate).<br/>
Copy the file "PREP_START.pdb" to a duplicate file called "dna.pdb". The file "log1" contains an additional warning
that we will take care of now, <i>viz.</i>, there is a complaint that water molecules are not found at the end of 
sequence input. This has something to do with specialized loops for force evaluations later on. To address it,
simply cut the ions section in "dna.pdb" (all residues with names "NA+" or "CL-" and paste it right before
the first instance of a residue with name "T4E". Note that it does not matter to CAMPARI that residue numbers
are now discontinuous (the only requirement is that they must change from residue to residue).
Analogously, copy the file "prep.seq" to a file
"tutorial6.seq" and perform the same cut-and-paste operation before proceeding to the next step.<br/>
<br/><big style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Step 2 - Create a pdb-file of a partially randomized system</big><br/>
<br/>
With the converted pdb-file of the piece of DNA with ions in hand, we will now, in a second step, generate 
a snapshot of the actual system of interest (including water at the correct density). For this purpose, modify
existing entries in prep.key as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#SEQFILE">FMCSC_SEQFILE</a> tutorial6.seq<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">FMCSC_PDBFILE</a> dna.pdb<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> 100000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_R_CONV">FMCSC_PDB_R_CONV</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_HMODE">FMCSC_PDB_HMODE</a> 1<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
We also need to add:
<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_INPUTSTRING">FMCSC_PDB_INPUTSTRING</a> "a6,a5,1x,a4,a1,a3,1x,a1,i4,a1,3x,3f18.10"<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This keyword above tells CAMPARI that it should expect "dna.pdb" to be in the format as specified. Note
that the second field is always treated as a character variable on input and as an integer on output (this 
is the only difference to the setting for <a href="keywords.html#PDB_OUTPUTSTRING">FMCSC_PDB_OUTPUTSTRING</a>
above). Our final system is meant to contain 6700 water molecules, and we need to edit the sequence file to reflect this.
For example:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
awk -v cnt=0 '{if ($1 == "T4E") {cnt=cnt+1} if ($1 == "END") {for (k=0;k&lt;6700-cnt;k++) {printf("T4E\n")} print "END"; exit} else {print}}' tutorial6.seq &gt; tmpseq<br/>
mv tmpseq tutorial6.seq<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
As for the ions, CAMPARI will automatically generate random starting positions
for all the missing water molecules (and it could do so also for many missing parts of polymers, 
see <a href="keywords.html#RANDOMIZE">FMCSC_RANDOMIZE</a> for details).
For a condensed phase system, the difficulty, as you may have seen already in 
<a href="tutorial5.html">Tutorial 5</a>, is of course the density.
The full <a href="../examples/tutorial6/tutorial6.seq">sequence file</a> 
contains 6700 water molecules, 87 sodium ions, 65 chloride ions, and the two DNA chains
making for an overall density of approximately
1.02g&#183;cm<sup>-3</sup> with the chosen box dimensions. Note that our box is 
certainly too small to study counterion effects around a piece of DNA with appreciable accuracy,
but the smaller size helps making this tutorial more tractable.
Periodic boundary conditions as chosen here are by far the most common choice for simulations
employing explicit solvent since they are thought to minimize boundary artifacts.<br/>
Thus far, we have not specified an interaction model, but note that <a href="keywords.html#SC_IPP">excluded volume interactions</a>
are turned on by default. As can be gleaned from the setting for <a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a>
above, we plan to perform some sort of preliminary simulation. To be specific,
we wish to use Monte Carlo sampling in rigid-body space to solvate the structure in "dna.pdb", which
already contains a number of water molecules and ions, with water but without too many steric clashes.
Most molecular simulation packages will typically have a protocol
to use preexisting water boxes to "soak" a macromolecule. Instead, here we will use CAMPARI to 
create our own custom system completely from scratch. This has its advantages as it
is a general strategy that can be used for any solvent (including solvent mixtures of arbitrary
complexity). To make sure that this preliminary Monte Carlo run proceeds at appreciable pace,
add the following lines:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#CUTOFFMODE">FMCSC_CUTOFFMODE</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NBCUTOFF">FMCSC_NBCUTOFF</a> 10.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#GRIDDIM">FMCSC_GRIDDIM</a> 10 10 10<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#GRIDMAXGPNB">FMCSC_GRIDMAXGPNB</a> 1024<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#N2LOOP">FMCSC_N2LOOP</a> 0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CHECKFREQ">FMCSC_CHECKFREQ</a> 10000000<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Here, we instruct CAMPARI to use grid-based interaction cutoffs which is common practice
in most modern simulation software. We should also provide details of the move set
so that it is better-suited to our task than the default settings:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#RIGIDFREQ">FMCSC_RIGIDFREQ</a> 1.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#RIGIDRDFREQ">FMCSC_RIGIDRDFREQ</a> 0.1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TRANSSTEPSZ">FMCSC_TRANSSTEPSZ</a> 0.3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#ROTSTEPSZ">FMCSC_ROTSTEPSZ</a> 10.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#FRZREPORT">FMCSC_FRZREPORT</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#FRZFILE">FMCSC_FRZFILE</a> &lt;full path to CAMPARI directory&gt;/examples/tutorial6/tutorial6.frz<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The MC move set is focused entirely on rigid-body motion. The step sizes are suitably small
for a condensed phase system. In addition, we constrain the positions of 
the two DNA chains to prevent changes in their relative orientation from happening.
 The <a href="../examples/tutorial6/tutorial6.frz">input file</a>
is very simple and its format is explained <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_FRZFILE">elsewhere</a>.<br/>
Lastly, like in <a href="tutorial5.html">Tutorial 5</a>, we should use the OpenMP-threaded version
to speed things up:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#NRTHREADS">FMCSC_NRTHREADS</a> 4 # if you can allow it, set it to the number of physical or even logical cores in your system (hyperthreading can be beneficial)<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#THREADS_VERBOSE">FMCSC_THREADS_VERBOSE</a> 1 # level of diagnostic output<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#THREADS_DLB_FREQ">FMCSC_THREADS_DLB_FREQ</a> 500 # restarts DLB segments every X steps<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#THREADS_DLB_STOP">FMCSC_THREADS_DLB_STOP</a> 300 # stops DLB for each segment after X steps<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#THREADS_DLB_FREQ">FMCSC_THREADS_DLB_EXT</a> 1 # accumulate load data over X steps for DLB adjustments<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
These dynamic load balancing settings are appropriate for the subsequent molecular dynamics we will perform.
Note that we are still relying only on excluded volume for solvent placement, which will lead to
a starting structure that has no knowledge about hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions.
We can now run CAMPARI again as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari_threads -k prep.key &gt;&amp; log2 &amp;<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This should not take more than a few minutes. We obtain a pdb-file called
"PREP_END.pdb" that you should rename to "MCsoaked.pdb".<br/>
<br/><big style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Step 3 - Create the minimized pdb-file to start production simulations from</big><br/>
<br/>
For the actual simulation and the prior "minimization", we will use a standard molecular dynamics
protocol in Cartesian space using a thermostat to obtain the canonical (NVT) ensemble. This means
that you should remove or comment the lines requesting explicit constraints on the DNA from prep.key (see above,
keyword <a href="keywords.html#FRZFILE">FMCSC_FRZFILE</a>).
After doing that, append the key-file by:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#ENSEMBLE">FMCSC_ENSEMBLE</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#DYNAMICS">FMCSC_DYNAMICS</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TSTAT">FMCSC_TSTAT</a> 4<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CARTINT">FMCSC_CARTINT</a> 2<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The thermostat used throughout the rest of this tutorial is the <a href="keywords.html#TSTAT">
velocity-rescaling thermostat</a> of <a href="references.html#ref12_3">Bussi <i>et al.</i></a>.
There is a small discussion of thermostats also in <a href="tutorial5.html">Tutorial 5</a>
Previously, we operated in a rigid body space that satisfied desired constraints on bond lengths and angles automatically.
Our choice for keyword <a href="keywords.html#CARTINT">FMCSC_CARTINT</a> above means that we switch
to Cartesian degrees of freedom (atomic positions), which requires us to impose constant
bond lengths for all bonds for the DNA as holonomic constraints instead. In addition, the water model we use (TIP4P-Ewald) 
is parameterized as a rigid model which means that one additional constraint per molecule is needed
(note that lone-pair particle is kept rigid by different means due to its lack of mass).
In theory, we could use option 6 for keyword <a href="keywords.html#SHAKESET">FMCSC_SHAKESET</a>
to provide <a href="inputfiles.html#FMCSC_SHAKEFILE">an exact list</a> of the constraints we want.
If written properly, such a list would be parsed by CAMPARI, and during execution the coupled constraints on the DNA
molecules would be addressed by our choice of constraint solver whereas the ones on water would
be solved analytically by the so-called SETTLE (<a href="references.html#ref5_10">reference</a>) procedure
(CAMPARI will do this for all suitable
constraint groups). Since such a list may be inconvenient to prepare, we use the following syntax:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#SHAKEMETHOD">FMCSC_SHAKEMETHOD</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SHAKESET">FMCSC_SHAKESET</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SETTLEH2O">FMCSC_SETTLEH2O</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#SHAKEFROM">FMCSC_SHAKEFROM</a> 2<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
The third keyword above is in fact implied as a default choice (added for clarity here), and instructs CAMPARI to override
constraint choices via <a href="keywords.html#SHAKESET">FMCSC_SHAKESET</a> for all supported water
models (TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P-Ew, TIP5P, or SPC) in order to make them completely rigid. Here, this means that the choice via
<a href="keywords.html#SHAKESET">FMCSC_SHAKESET</a> 3 of just constraining bond lengths in water
molecules is replaced by complete rigidification. The fourth keyword, <a href="keywords.html#SHAKEFROM">FMCSC_SHAKEFROM</a>,
is important because it defines what to
actually set the constraints to. Option 2 means that these values are taken from the minimum positions
of bonded potentials (DNA) in "amber03.prm" or the published rigid geometries (water models).
This implies that the values of the constraints found in "MCsoaked.pdb", which are different, must be adjusted
(which happens before the simulation starts).
The remaining controllable parameters are left as default values.<br/>
We are now finally ready to specify the details of the realistic interaction model we plan on using.
Here, we try the <a href="references.html#ref1_18">2003 revision of the AMBER force field</a>, and can therefore paste a lot
of keywords straight from the <a href="keywords.html#AMBER">documentation</a>:<br/>

You are probably familiar with most of these terms by now (if not, click on the links). However,
the interaction model needs to be tuned to limit its range such that the simulation can be 
reasonably efficient. Part of it is the cutoff scheme we already introduced bits of.
However, truncation may be fine for true short-range interactions (inverse power potentials as in
Lennard-Jones), but is inappropriate for Coulomb interactions decaying with r<sup>-1</sup>.
In periodic systems, the infinite sum of Coulomb interactions within the "crystal" lattice
can be approximated by a grid-based numerical implementation of the Ewald decomposition of this sum,
commonly referred to as particle-mesh Ewald (PME) summation. This is what we are going to use:<br/>

<br/>
The <a href="keywords.html#EWFSPAC">Fourier spacing</a> (in &#8491;) and the
<a href="keywords.html#BSPLINE">order of the B-spline approximation</a> are 
the most common tunable parameters in PME. Note that when using an OpenMP-enabled CAMPARI executable,
the threads parallelization of the FFTW library is used as well. Since the performance
of this is not always easy to predict, keyword
<a href="keywords.html#THREADS_TEST">FMCSC_THREADS_TEST</a> offers a means to do some testing.
In dynamics, <a href="keywords.html#ELCUTOFF">FMCSC_ELCUTOFF</a>
is the outer cutoff of the twin-range regime. Interactions in this regime are only recomputed
every <a href="keywords.html#NBL_UP">FMCSC_NBL_UP</a> steps. 
For the PME method, it is most appropriate to use the same values for <a href="keywords.html#ELCUTOFF">FMCSC_ELCUTOFF</a>
and <a href="keywords.html#NBCUTOFF">FMCSC_NBCUTOFF</a> due to the altered functional form. It is difficult to tune the
parameter-dependent precision of the PME method exactly although it is usually 
relatively easy to find "safe" settings (where errors when comparing to a reference
set of parameters are marginal). This tutorial will not discuss the many intricacies
of the PME method. One should be clear, however, that any Ewald sum does imply that molecules "see" copies
of themselves at large distance, which, unless there are many molecules of a type in the central cell,
does <i>not</i> translate to a well-defined notion of concentration (since the relative orientation
cannot change of images).<br/>
Lastly, our first run will be very short, and use a small time step since, as alluded to above, the structure
we use is by no means equilibrated with respect to the Hamiltonian just defined. Change existing
entries in prep.key as:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>

<a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">FMCSC_PDBFILE</a> MCsoaked.pdb<br/>

</tt>
<br/>
Note that because our system is now fully flexible and we use <a href="keywords.html#SHAKEFROM">FMCSC_SHAKEFROM</a> to
reinitialize constraints to the correct values, the extended pdb format is no longer required
(the above setting is the standard one).
And add or replace the following lines:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#TIMESTEP">FMCSC_TIMESTEP</a> 0.00005<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TSTAT_TAU">FMCSC_TSTAT_TAU</a> 0.0005<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NBL_UP">FMCSC_NBL_UP</a> 1<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CHECKFREQ">FMCSC_CHECKFREQ</a> 100<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Because we expect a fast decrease in potential energy very quickly, we choose a very small time step
(0.05fs) and a very short coupling time to the thermostat (0.5fs) along with
neighbor list updates at every step. This will make the integration of 
equations of motion rather slow but is necessary to prevent the simulation
from "blowing up" due to integrator instability. We can now run CAMPARI for the third time:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari -k prep.key &gt;&amp; log3<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This again should only take a few minutes. Once complete, rename "PREP_END.pdb" one last time, this time to
"equil.pdb" (which should be a standard pdb file that can be visualized using any molecular viewer).
By inspecting "log3", you should confirm that the potential energy has dropped
to a "large" negative number (very crudely, approaching an energy of -10kcal/mol per water molecule).
Of course, the above run lasted only 50fs of actual simulation time, and was thus much to 
short to equilibrate other properties, <i>e.g.</i>, the positions of ions.
In case you wonder, note that there are several reasons why CAMPARI will not provide you
with the raw speed that other software packages like GROMACS may. This will still be apparent 
in the actual production run that we move on to now.<br/>
<br/><big style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Step 4 - Run the actual simulation and inspect the results</big><br/>
<br/>
For the production run, we will adjust settings so that the simulation runs more efficiently. Change existing
keywords as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#TIMESTEP">FMCSC_TIMESTEP</a> 0.002<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TSTAT_TAU">FMCSC_TSTAT_TAU</a> 2.0<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NBL_UP">FMCSC_NBL_UP</a> 5<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a> 250000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDBFILE">FMCSC_PDBFILE</a> equil.pdb<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_INPUTSTRING">FMCSC_PDB_INPUTSTRING</a> "a6,a5,1x,a4,a1,a3,1x,a1,i4,a1,3x,3f8.3" # or comment this keyword<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
We will simulate for 250000 steps (500ps).
We have also increased the update frequency for the neighbor list and adjusted time step and
coupling constant of the thermostat. Note that in CAMPARI, the effective cutoff is almost
always effectively larger than what is specified via the corresponding keywords. This is 
because neighbor relationships in CAMPARI are residue-based, not atom-based. This is both 
a nuisance (computationally more expensive) and necessary (Coulombic interactions should
always be cut off in a group-consistent fashion). Of course, there are other protocols
that can ensure the latter condition in a different manner. The only exception to this 
silent bloating of cutoffs are interactions that explicitly decay to zero at a given cutoff 
value such as the <a href="keywords.html#LREL_MD">reaction-field methods</a> for dealing
with long-range electrostatics.<br/>
The only missing thing now are analysis specifications. Above, we have disabled all analyses
by default (through keyword <a href="keywords.html#DISABLE_ANALYSIS">FMCSC_DISABLE_ANALYSIS</a>, so
you should enable whatever you are interested in collecting.
Since the time needed per step is pretty high
for this simulation, we do not expect analyses to become computationally limiting.
Note that CAMPARI by default will define single-residue molecules as solvent, which 
excludes them from analysis. To avoid this, we need to resort to
<a href="keyowrds.html#ANGRPFILE">analysis group files</a>. It is recommended to write 
such a file, "tutorial6.agp" that declares ions as solutes but leaves water as solvent. Then,
append the key-file as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
<a href="keywords.html#XYZOUT">FMCSC_XYZOUT</a> 100<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#XYZMODE">FMCSC_XYZMODE</a> 2<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#XYZPDB">FMCSC_XYZPDB</a> 3<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#TOROUT">FMCSC_TOROUT</a> 100<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#CONTACTCALC">FMCSC_CONTACTCALC</a> 50<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#PCCALC">FMCSC_PCCALC</a> 50<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#EQUIL">FMCSC_EQUIL</a> 50000<br/>
<a href="keywords.html#FLUSHTIME">FMCSC_FLUSHTIME</a> 1.0<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
These keywords enable several output files, including a <a href="outputfiles.html#CONTACTMAP.dat">contact map</a>,
<a href="outputfiles.html#RBC_PC.dat">site-site correlation functions</a> based on centers of mass,
and a <a href="outputfiles.html#basename_traj.dcd">trajectory file in dcd-format</a>.
For all of these, we request the first 100ps to be discarded as equilibration.
Now execute:<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
campari_threads -k prep.key &gt;&amp; log4 &amp;<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
Depending on the number of available threads, this will take quite some time to complete
(hours or more). You can track progress from the output in
<a href="outputfiles.html#THREADS.log">THREADS.log</a>. It is possible that
the simulation crashes very early on, and this may indicate that the structure in "equil.pdb" still carries
some minor clashes that compromise integrator stability. If this happens, or if an initial inspection
of instantaneous temperatures in "log4" suggests to you that the system is running "too hot", 
you can repeat Step 3 form the beginning with a larger value for <a href="keywords.html#NRSTEPS">FMCSC_NRSTEPS</a>.
Alternatively, it should be a straightforward extension to simply repeat Step 3  with "equil.pdb" as input
(but make sure that the input file, <a href="keywords.html#PDB_INPUTSTRING">FMCSC_PDB_INPUTSTRING</a>, and
<a href="keywords.html#PDB_OUTPUTSTRING">FMCSC_PDB_OUTPUTSTRING</a> always remain consistent), This can also
be done iteratively while gradually increasing the <a href="keywords.html#TIMESTEP">time step</a>
and the <a href="keywords.html#TSTAT_TAU">thermostat coupling time</a>.
In rare cases, a crash may also indicate that the input geometry
of the DNA was altered due to bond angle or length violations. In this latter case, it may be required to 
increase the tolerance thresholds for this with the help of keywords <a href="keywords.html#PDB_TOLERANCE_B">FMCSC_PDB_TOLERANCE_B</a>
and <a href="keywords.html#PDB_TOLERANCE_A">FMCSC_PDB_TOLERANCE_A</a>. All of the above issues can be diagnosed
with the help of the initial output in "log4". This should be inspected right after 
the start of the simulation.<br/>
After the production simulation has finished, check the final output in "log4" to make sure everything went fine
(look at the reported average temperature and so forth). As the next step, it is probably most informative to use
<a href="references.html#ref23_9">VMD</a> to have a look at the trajectory data (for this, it is important
that the pdb files used as templates are in standard format):<br/>
<br/>
<tt>
vmd -e PREP_VIS.vmd<br/>
</tt>
<br/>
This should typically load the trajectory (irrespective of format) and create some common
graphical representations. At first sight, you will mostly see water, but - assuming a certain
familiarity with VMD - it should be straightforward to make the water invisible or to just visualize
the solvent layer around DNA. Further things to try:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Try to determine and plot RMSD of DNA over time (several ways)</li>
<li>In addition to the ion-ion <a href="keywords.html#PCCALC">site-site correlation functions</a>, try to obtain ion-phosphate ones using the <a href="keywords.html#PDBANALYZE"> trajectory analysis</a> feature of CAMPARI</li>
<li>Analyze sugar pucker distributions and (if applicable) isomerization frequencies using the output in
<a href="outputfiles.html#FYC.dat">FYC.dat</a> that was created on-the-fly.</li>
</ul>
This ends this tutorial. We wish to reiterate that this is a bad example of actual
simulation work since no scientific question is posed upfront. It will almost always be
difficult to follow this type of inverted, <i>a posteriori</i> work flow. The simulation presented here, for example,
is unable to make accurate and quantitative predictions about ion-DNA distribution functions (box
too small, too short), about B-DNA stability (orders of magnitude too short), or non-classical base stacking
interactions (not even part of the force field). Other tutorials (such as <a href="tutorial3.html">#3</a>
or <a href="tutorial7.html">#7</a>) are much better examples in this regard.<br/>
