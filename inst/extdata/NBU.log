 Warning. When running trajectory analysis mode on a pdb file (FMCSC_PDBFILE), FMCSC_PDB_READMODE must be 2 (adjusted automatically), and the entire system must be present (otherwise an error will be produced).

 No polypeptides found with suitable residues to perform secondary structure segment or global content analyses. Turning off analyses.
 Warning. No polypeptide residues found. Turning DSSP analysis and/or restraint potential off.
 Warning. Within an MC simulation using a single molecular reference frame, it is probably inefficient to do (partial or rigorous) C-terminal alignment. Consider using N-terminal alignment instead.
 Warning. Cannot open assumed input file (/usr/local/campari/examples/yourcalc.pfs) for FMCSC_PSWFILE. Assuming default weights (see documentation).
 WARNING: Cannot open spec.d input file (/usr/local/campari/examples/test.idx) for FMCSC_PCCODEFILE. Turning off general PC analysis.
 WARNING: Cannot open spec.d input file (/usr/local/campari/examples/clustering.idx) for FMCSC_CFILE. Assuming full-size request (all-atom, all-torsion, etc. ...).
 Due to missing input for FMCSC_CFILE for distance criteria 7-9, a set of           42  interatomic distances with randomly selected atoms will be used.

 Polymers are built with all hydrogen atoms (All-Atom Model).

 Modified NB model used (all atoms separated by rigid or quasi-rigid bonds only are excluded from NB energy evaluations).
 Fudge factors for 14-interactions are assigned whenever exactly three bonds (the middle one rotatable) separate two atoms.


 Polymer chains (if any) are linear and non-cyclic.
