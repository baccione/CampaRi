```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(progress = FALSE)
# knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="to_d/")
```

## Feature selection

Using the default R PCA algorithms (or the enhanced ones which are slow (PCAproj)) this function select the features with the biggest loading. It is also possible to plot the result in 2-3 components.

```{r}
library(mlbench)
data(PimaIndiansDiabetes)





```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
